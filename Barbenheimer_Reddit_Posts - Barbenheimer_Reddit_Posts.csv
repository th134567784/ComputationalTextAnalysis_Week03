Thought of the next Barbenheimer....Mean Souls,https://i.redd.it/k679cte09cbc1.jpeg,"Depending on where you're from, Disney is bringing Soul to theaters this weekend. Mean Girls: The Musical also comes out this weekend. You might want to check your area to see if you're getting the Soul re release, and if Mean Girls: The Musical is also playing I'd suggest doing Mean Souls!

The new Mean Girls is actually Mean Girls: The Musical, Paramount actually had that as the original title but they're selling it as a remake when it's a musical.",8,0.9,2024-01-09 4:01:13,1

An overlooked lesson of Barbenheimer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/190cj7v/an_overlooked_lesson_of_barbenheimer/,"Fewer people are going to the movies. Movie tickets and concessions are more expensive these days (except for people with movie passes/subscriptions), and the rise of the internet and streaming mean that there are a lot of cheaper options for entertainment these days. 

Given those things, I wonder part of the reason for the huge success of Barbie and Oppenheimer is that they both appealed to people in the professional middle-class, ie people with money to spend on going to the movies. They are about other things too, but Barbie is about the struggles of professional women to be taken seriously and get ahead in the world, and Oppenheimer is about the struggle between professionals who actually care about the consequences of their work and those playing petty status games.

Films have traditionally been divided into stuff for the masses, and high-art for the Oscars and stuff, but I wonder if the changing economics of going to the movies means that the sweet spot is now in the middle. Upper-middle class professionals are not auteurs who care about the high art of cinema, but they don't want mindless junk either. They want stuff that feels relevant to them and looks good on IMAX, and Barbie and Oppenheimer succeeded because they delivered on that.

Critics Choice Predictions for the (theoretically) competitive categories,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/196lebk/critics_choice_predictions_for_the_theoretically/,"So I was going to post predictions for all categories like I normally do, but since almost all of them seem borderline locked, I’ll only post the ones where I’m predicting an upset or that I feel require commentary. Everything not listed here that I’m predicting is #1 on [Goldderby](https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/critics-choice-film-awards-2024-predictions/) and requires no explanation.

&#x200B;

**Best Supporting Actor**

**Ryan Gosling, Barbie**

(Alternate: Robert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer)

Gosling has such an insane amount of hype from Film Twitter and pundits that I think he’ll be the rare instance of passion prevailing over the Oscar favourite. If he loses here then I’d say he’s likely done for the Oscar, there’s so little excuse it’s not even funny.

&#x200B;

**Best Adapted Screenplay**

**Oppenheimer**

(Alternate: American Fiction)

Poor Things just feels like too inspired of a lock for Critics Choice to go for. Oppenheimer’s the critics frontrunner in Adapted and this is an easy place to check it off. If something were to upset I’d bet on American Fiction since it does feel like the socially conscious/funny topical satire that CC tends to like.

&#x200B;

**Best Film Ensemble**

**Barbie**

(Alternate: Oppenheimer)

I was really close to swapping these two and even might have, but Goldderby closed before I could lol. Anyways, I noticed there’s been an extremely low correlation between Ensemble and Picture, the last one being Spotlight, which only got three awards total. Obviously, they’re gonna love Oppenheimer, but will they love it so much that they give it a win even here when Barbie is more to their tastes? 

I also think Colour Purple absolutely makes sense as a surprise winner, since it fits the profile of the also-ran like Glass Onion last year and has been doing decently in the category. Not gonna take the risk and go for it though because ~~Goldderby closed super early for no reason~~ it has been underperforming basically the entire season and I’m not totally convinced it will have the passion to overcome Barbenheimer here.

&#x200B;

**Best Comedy Film**

**Barbie**

(Alternate: American Fiction)

This award serves as a consolation for not necessarily the strongest comedy contender that’s not winning BP, but just seemingly the most comedic film that’s somewhat on the map awards-wise (ie Bridesmaids, Crazy Rich Asians, Glass Onion). But Bottoms and No Hard Feelings most definitely are not awards adjacent like those movies and none of the Barbie alternatives are capital-C comedies like they go for. American Fiction might be an exception to that but I haven’t been able to watch it and confirm as much, so I’m just gonna have it as my alternate.

&#x200B;

**Best Animated Film**

**Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse**

(Alternate: The Boy and the Heron)

Boy and the Heron’s Globe win could definitely give it momentum for voters here to think it’s the new frontrunner and thus vote for it, but it’s clear that CC voters lean a lot more mainstream and will probably just go for Spider-Verse. 

&#x200B;

**Best Song**

**“I’m Just Ken,” Barbie**

Alternate: “What Was I Made For,” Barbie

Like Gosling the hype this has among Film Twitter types feels overwhelming, but in this case it’s even closer since they could easily just namecheck Eilish after the Globes win. Ultimately I still think the buzz around Barbie will duplicate here, since it seems like the people who love the movie go to Ken more than Made For.

&#x200B;

**Best Visual Effects**

**Oppenheimer**

(Alternate: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse)

TAR last year proved that voters will just check off their favourite movie in tech categories and I’d imagine many of them are just as, if not more apathetic to VFX. I could see a case for anything but Guardians and Mission: Impossible winning: Poor Things as the consolation prize, The Creator to predict the Oscars, and Spider-Verse as the surprise passion pick. Ultimately I don’t think there’ll be much consensus and the strongest film will win.",9,0.8,2024-01-14 17:41:31,1

**Taylor Swift** was the talk of the 81st Golden Globe Awards! That’s because, the ceremony was held on Earth, and somehow Taylor Swift has managed to configure herself into the axis around which our beautiful blue sphere now orbits.

Despite two wars, a climate crisis, and the world living under constant threat of another *The Fast and the Furious* movie, the global press summoned all of its resources to report and analyze Taylor’s every movent, gesture, and facial expression in near real time.

By Monday, they had moved on to all things and people Taylor adjacent. In particular, internet sleuths fixed their gave on singer/actress **Selena Gomez**, who cameras captured whispering giddily to Swift throughout the night.

"Jo Koy’s Golden Globes Barbie joke was intended to keep the movie relevant in media discourse, regardless of whether it won",https://www.reddit.com/r/LowStakesConspiracies/comments/1920vid/jo_koys_golden_globes_barbie_joke_was_intended_to/,"So the internet is awash with criticism towards Jo Koy’s joke that Barbie was just a film about a character known for big boobs and people are up in arms that it offends the very existence of the movie which tries to tackle the objectification of women.

Now, Oppenheimer stole the show at the Golden Globes, meaning it’s dominating headlines and media outlets, arguably “winning” the whole Barbenheimer competition, if winning is measured in awards. The controversy around Koy’s joke (which allegedly multiple people read and approved), blatantly was going to offend fans of the movie as it so obviously challenged everything the movie stood for. The joke was therefore used so that even if Barbie lost at the Globes, it would stay relevant, selling more toys, receiving more attention and potentially leading more people to watch it.",7,0.68,2024-01-09 0:24:39,2

To prevent a partial [government](https://worldmagzine.com/india/covid-news-updates-the-karnataka-government-has-set-up-a-committee-to-deal-with-the-situation/) shutdown, US senators succeeded in reaching a $1.4 trillion agreement on the overall amount of spending for the remainder of 2024 on Sunday, January 7.

Which movies announced for 2024 have the best chance of becoming cultural events?,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18z6r6a/which_movies_announced_for_2024_have_the_best/,"If you look at the highest grossing movies of last year, Barbie, Mario, Oppenheimer and to a lesser extent, even GotG 3, all of them weren't just good movies people generally liked. Their release was also big cultural events everybody was talking about. Going to see those movies wasn't just about having an enjoyable experience in the cinema. It was about not missing out on the current moment.

And I think that's what it takes right now for a movie to break out and join the one billion dollar club.

Barbenheimer needs no explanation, Mario was a fairly universally beloved character and world, for the first time done ""right"" on the big screen and Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was the final chapter for the underdog break-out stars of the MCU, and for many probably the cathartic end to the entire franchise that people feel has run its course.

It seems like there is a growing segment of cinema goers who will only show up for what they perceive to be big culture events, and just wait for the rest to come out on streaming.

There was a post a couple of days ago asking what movies people think will earn over a billion dollars this years, and suggested Deadpool 3, Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4 as their picks.

I think all three of these movies will most likely make a decent amount of money. They are almost guaranteed profit drivers. But exactly because they are so safe, I think they're actually less likely to break-out and become big cultural events. We all already know pretty much what to expect from them. I'm ready to be proven wrong but I don't expect any big surprises from any of them.

I have some theories on which movies have a chance to break out like this. Those theories come with a couple of caveats, though. Firstly, it is completely dependent on the quality of the movies, of course. If the movies don't live up to their potential, people aren't going to want to watch them. And secondly, I acknowledge that these movies have a lower expected value (in the mathematical sense) than those safe earners. On average, these movies probably make less money, but I think they have a chance to become something special.

Firstly I want to talk about Joker 2: Folie à Deux. Yes, there is a danger that it being a musical will put people off. It's too different what people liked about the original and it doesn't manage to pull people in who were put off by the concept of a Joker movie in the first place. 

But I also think there is an outside chance that this actually becomes Barbenheimer in one movie. Tell someone who is a fan of Lady Gaga's music that Joker 2 has Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn and it's a musical and watch their reaction. I think this has more draw to more people than people on here give it credit for. Similar to Barbenheimer the premise of this movie juxtaposes destructiveness and beauty, femininity and masculinity, sadness and brightness, only to come to the conclusion that they are part of the same thing and don't stand in conflict with one another. I really liked how Barbenheimer went from a ""this vs that"" to ""both are good in their own way and we don't have to choose"" in culture last year. And maybe Joker 2 can be that synthesis.

Or maybe in trying to be two things it will be for nobody and crash and burn instead. Who knows.

The other movie I want to suggest in that vein is Furiosa. The justification for that is much less high-minded. The argument is more that it has a chance to be a visual spectacle in the vein of Avatar. Something that you have to see in cinemas to get the true experience so people go and see it. But Fury Road, while talked about a lot didn't set the world on fire, if you look at the numbers. And people are probably rightfully skeptical of Anya Taylor Joy to carry the movie the way Charlize Theron did.

Maybe George Miller can't recapture the magic and this movie actually completely bombs. But there is a potential here for a visual spectacle that people won't want to miss.

Lastly, I think Dune 2 straddles the line. The books are well liked and people want a good adaptation of them. But are they well liked enough for a good adaptation to drive a cultural moment? Do they have set-pieces impressive enough to marvel people with their visual splendor? I'm not sure",10,0.78,2024-01-05 13:22:00,22
Thaleskip #3: Samson and Delilah (1949),https://www.reddit.com/r/100movies365days/comments/19160zl/thaleskip_3_samson_and_delilah_1949/,"Date started: 1/1/2024

Date watched: 1/7/2024

As a fan of *The Ten Commandments* and *Ben-Hur*, I guess I have a thing for Biblical epics, a common movie genre in the 1950s. *Samson and Delilah* was the one that started the trend. It’s hard to imagine now, but when it came out, this movie’s popularity and success was comparable to Barbenheimer.

It isn’t exactly based on a stuffy Sunday school story. The original, taking up 5 pages of the Bible, is violent and strange, and Cecil B. DeMille took some liberties with it. Samson is more of a heroic himbo, rather than a brute who sleeps with prostitutes, sets foxes on fire, and rips beehives out of lion guts. Delilah plays a pretty minor role in the original story, but the movie elevates her to leading lady, and the two of them have a very Old Hollywood type of romance.

It’s easy to imagine this wowing the audiences of 1949, who had probably never seen anything this epic and spectacular, and in vibrant Technicolor too. Nowadays, it feels more like an artifact of the time it was made than of ancient Judea. The acting, dialogue, and fight scenes can get pretty cheesy, but they have their charm. Hedy Lamarr as Delilah and George Sanders as the oily-voiced Saran of Gaza put on the best performances of the movie, but they were no exception. Victor Mature as Samson is the definition of the bland, generic Hollywood leading man. When Charlton Heston played Moses 7 years later, you could believe that he had the authority to lead a people. But I don’t think even he could make a line like “Your arms were quicksand. Your kiss was death.” work.

I don’t want to judge it by modern standards, but the movie is overshadowed by other Biblical epics that came out just a few years after. For its time, it was a very impressive film, and the sequence in the Temple of Dagon at the end is still pure spectacle. But in 2024, maybe it’s only for people with an interest in that era of Hollywood. And even then, there’s better stuff from that time.

The 2023 domestic box office surpassed $9 billion, the highest since the pandemic, Comscore said. However, it’s still $2 billion short of the yearly movie ticket sales reached before the pandemic.

Despite a tepid fall season at the box office, the viral “Barbenheimer” phenomenon delivered a stunning boost to movie ticket sales this year. Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” brought in about $636 million domestically and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” raked in $326 million, according to Box Office Mojo.

Westerner Asks: Why couldn't the teams behind 'Dunki' and 'Salaar' stir up a Barbehnheimer moment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/18sxkg6/westerner_asks_why_couldnt_the_teams_behind_dunki/,"Hi! So, I've been catching up a lot on this subreddit about Bolly and Indian cinema dirt, and I mean **a lot**. It's very interesting to notice which patterns are similar to what you see in Hollywood (studio accounting fuckery), and which are different (so, KwK is basically one of those *Real Housewives* reunions but with A-listers?). 

Which leads me to: How could the studios, PR teams and fandoms behind *Dunki* and *Salaar* fuck this up so thoroughly? They had a perfect, purely organic Barbenheimer moment and they fumbled it on petty shit. Granted, there was shady kneecapping between WB and Universal with the release date and the number of available IMAX screens, but ultimately, both the fandoms and the stars worked off each other into a friendly, meme-driven rivalry, that turned both pics into even bigger hits than most projections. It didn't matter which one came first and which one was a bigger success when the baseline was *Oppenheimer's* nearing a billion.

They could've had the same with *Salaar* and *Dunki*. Just like Barbenheimer, they were two very different tentpoles, led by two very popular and distinctive directors, each starring people from a variety of fanbases. Granted, Cillian Murphy is nowhere near as big as Prabhas or SRK, but he is pretty popular from his *Peaky* *Blinders* work. Granted II, the average Hollywood tentpole opens in more screens in the USA than there are screens in India, period. But Hombale and Red Chillies could've found a way to make it work.

Certainly they're both doing pretty well, whatever the true box office of *Salaar* is, but their success has been despite both studios playing against each other. If they had played into it, tacitly cooperating, who knows, two 1,000 Crore grossers to finish the year? Why didn't they?",9,0.68,2023-12-28 16:14:05,12

1. Top quality AI-related clips posted by our OC memer u/shadykaran brought so much visibility as well as mainstream media's attention. u/Bluebadaam's OC review content is  also hit among memers.
2. Year's most disappointing venture by Adipurush\[starring Prabhas\] was taken to the cleaners by Memers.
3. Mimicry videos specially of Dr. Saket Bhosale's were BIG hit among memers.
4. We'd like to specially thank memers u/SalaNaamKyaRakhun, u/livingfeelsachore & u/Adventurous_Lab_ who've posted top quality memes and drawn good noise from members. We'd also like to thank u/aphrodi7 for conceptualizing JAWAN Teaser Contest concept and distributing many awards including Gold Awards among memers. Lastly, our fellow memer u/GokuSonWukong brought huge smiles to our memers by providing them with several Dunki/Salaar tickets as well as a year-long Netflix subscription for a lucky memer.
5. BW's Barbenheimer AI Clips attracted media/memer's attention and many BW clips/memes related to the trend were also pleasantly received.
6. Fanwars posted by DP/Kat/Alia/RK/SRK/Bhoi/Akki fans were received very well by memers. Recently, KWK fanwar memes starring DP received lot of traction.
7. Gadar 2's roaring success managed to bring many stars fans together and there was literally fanwar in posts/comments sections.
8. Jawan's magnanimous hype attracted interesting content from many SRK fans.
9. Announcement of Ranveer for Don 3 irked many a memers here, D3's teaser memes were smashing succes.
10. With release of Animal, there was very high number of memes posted with Lord Bobby's Jamal Kudu clips/BGM as well as ""Sunai Nahi De Raha"" clips.
11. Last & the Best part of the year 2023 was witnessing the clash between DUNKI & SALAAR on BO, Meme sub made sure that there is unprecedented engagement from both SRK as well as Prabhas fans. There were also so many vile/abusive comments from visitors/members which needed course correction quickly.

We thank all the active memers who participated in 2023's Meme contests. We're expecting to hit **500K** in next couple of months and would like to plan some exciting contests by then.

Compared to Jan 2023, December had about 30X engagement and Last November, sub had best activity of the year only to be bested by more than twice over engagement in December. Its good that we're growing fast but we also intend Sub to be a pleasant and funny place for everyone. That's why, Mods request memers to be respectful towards others and not resort to any abuses or give any religious/racial/shaming/misogynistic slurs in comments for upcoming year. Apart from this, we're looking for OC Memers who can draw in HUGE traffic for us. Let us know what you think we missed here or what more this sub/mods can do in 2024.

We thank you for your constant love and support. We're expecting to become a MASSIVE community this year in 2024.

Wishing you all a **HAPPY NEW YEAR 2024** from BW Memes Mod Team...",6,1,2023-12-31 20:24:23,11

"If superhero movies were to the 2010's what hair metal was to the 1980's, then what do we think is the Nirvana that made superheroes uncool?",https://www.reddit.com/r/decadeology/comments/18uho5b/if_superhero_movies_were_to_the_2010s_what_hair/,"Much has been said about the sudden decline in popularity of superhero movies in the last few years, along with the whole Disney/Marvel industrial complex. In the 2010's, Marvel and DC dominated popular movies the same way that hair metal groups did in the 1980's: it was often loud, dumb, completely over-the-top, occasionally talented and profound, and having legions of die-hard fans *and* critics.

But since the turn of the decade, much of the big superhero projects have been flaming out with critics and audiences, with many Marvel and DC movies and shows not making the impact they used to or outright bombing (Morbius, Quantumania, Secret Invasion, The Flash, etc). Right now, they’re where hair metal bands were in the 90’s; after dominating music for the previous decade, Nirvana comes along in ‘91 and makes them all look passé.

What are some movies and shows that we think are single-handedly responsible for making superheroes irrelevant? As in, a movie or movement that satisfies audiences and critics who want something fresh, original, or real. For example:

* Dune, a big-budget sci-fi epic based on decades-old source material with a big ensemble cast that was more serious than what superhero movies were providing
* Everything Everywhere All At Once, which tackles the multiverse in a much more effective way than Marvel or DC did, and dominated awards season like no other movie did before
* Top Gun 2 and Avatar 2, the two global mega-blockbusters of 2022 that managed to be sincere and tell a complete story, with breathtaking visuals and coherent action and genuine emotions
* RRR, the rare Indian action movie to break out in the US and put American blockbusters to shame
* Barbenheimer, the double-feature phenomenon of 2023 that gave audiences two distinct movies from auteurs with a clear vision on their subjects
* Or there's Martin Scorsese's comments about Marvel not being ""real cinema,"" which could be compared to Disco Demolition Night in the 1970's: occurs at the decade's tail end and immediately makes the genre look phony and uncool to the masses.

(NOTE: While you could say CBM’s did this to themselves with poor writing or production issues, some were still successful on their own, like Spider-Verse, The Batman, GotG3, Peacemaker, Black Panther 2, or No Way Home. But *something* else had to come along and expose the flaws of superhero culture.)",23,0.94,2023-12-30 15:09:59,19

What 2023 Events did you wished Last Week Tonight would have joked about?,https://www.reddit.com/r/lastweektonight/comments/18q4plu/what_2023_events_did_you_wished_last_week_tonight/,"Title says it all: What 2023 Events did you wished Last Week Tonight would have joked about?

For me, I wished he would have touched on:

* ~~Barbenheimer (if it was, I don't recall)~~
* Canadian parliament giving a standing ovation to a Nazi Veteran
* The Congressional Hearing if Ivy League Deans on anti-Semitism
* The leaked staffer sex tape filmed in the Congressional Hearing Room.

Given the writer's strike and their time constraints, It's understandable they weren't covered.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I forgot Barbenheimer was covered in their episode after the strike.  I apologize for the oversight.",88,0.93,2023-12-24 21:50:59,46

"I've seen some people say that 2023 was ""uneventful"" for pop culture and im gonna have to HARD disagree.",https://www.reddit.com/r/decadeology/comments/18qu4ut/ive_seen_some_people_say_that_2023_was_uneventful/,"The movie industry has been dramatically shaken up this year. There was the actor/writers strike that caused a bunch of delays, the rise in popularity of more artsy or prestige movies (like oppenheimer for example) the barbenheimer phenomenon, and the rise of mcu/superhwro fatigue and disney fatigue. Like this year was catastrophic for disney, a huge shift is happening, like thats a pretty big deal. The Spiderverse stylized animation revival also continues with TMNT and the 2nd Spiderverse movie and its continuing to outperform the disney/pixar realism style that dominated for so long

And even though Elon Musks purchase of twitter was in like November last year, his fiasco and mismanagement of Twitter was primarily this year, finally putting the nail in the coffin of his reputation in the eyes of the general public. Fortnite is seeing a nostalgic revival. 2020s design trends are here with bento boxes, quirky fonts, and the steps away from 2010s mininalism. 2020s fashion is solidified too with the 2000s inspiration trends.

In terms of world events The Israel/Hamas war has greately captured the American public too. Yeah i just thinl it was a way more relavant year then people are making it out to be.Trump got a GOD DAMN MUGSHOT. Like that is going to be a historic photo?? Hello??

Also i just wanna say i speak from a largely american perpsective as an american lol

I saw 54 movies in a theater this year. Here is my personal Ranking list,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18sya1v/i_saw_54_movies_in_a_theater_this_year_here_is_my/,"Hello to anyone interested and about to read/skim this list and either comment on how good or bad it is. I went in with the New Year's Resolution that since I am a cinephile, subscribe to A-List, and have 3 AMCs within 25 minutes of my house, I would do what I can to see 53 movies this year, or one movie a week. I am happy to say that I exceeded this by one film. And with that, I have my final rankings for every film I've seen this year.

Before you read the list/reviews, here are some quick notes:

\- 54-49: Pretty much the worst films I saw this year. These are films I would not recommend to anyone in the future, and if it's ever mentioned in conversation, I will most likely say negative things about the film

\- 48-40: are watchable films, with decent elements, but also aren't that good, and are likely lacking in a lot of other areas. I would likely recommend the film, but also give a critique or two that I thought was missing

\- 39-21: Pretty much passable/watchable films that I at least thought were worth sitting through once, and could see myself sitting through again at some point in the future

\- 20-11: These are films I found pretty enjoyable from start to finish with very few issues that I could find in between. The higher these films are, the likelier it is that I would want to or be happy to watch these films again

\- 10-1: These are my personal best of the best. They are films that I will definitely find myself watching again at some point in the future, and will only speak positively about each movie

&#x200B;

The List:

54.. 65 - Directed by Scott Beck, Bryan Woods: Another interesting dinosaur concept that completely goes to waste in a dull and uninspired movie with barely any dinosaurs, and way too much of Koa.

53.. Exorcist: Believer - Directed by David Gordon Green: I read that this was supposed to be the beginning of a new Exorcist series… Welp. Good luck with that. The only great thing about this movie is Ellen Burstyn creating a scholarship program at Pace University for young actors. Way to fucking go Ellen.

52.. Shazam: Fury of the Gods - Directed by David F. Sandberg: I am aware the director is a user on Reddit so if he stumbles upon this, I am sorry-ish about the ranking, man. For a follow-up to my favorite DCEU film… This was not it. The adults were shown more than the teens, which is unfortunate because I loved the teens and their chemistry a lot. There is also a subplot where one of the teenagers falls for a 1,000-year-old princess who you don’t know is a villain or sidekick, but that’s neither here nor there. When Helen and Lucy are not putting in genuine effort in this movie, it’s admittedly a point that’s not worth considering

51.. AntMan: QuantuMania - Directed by Peyton Reed - This, in my eyes, is the film most will reflect on as the beginning of the “CBM fatigue”. Stakes felt low and played out before. Not to mention the VFX looked pretty bad, in addition to the script being genuinely awful. Oh, and did I mention the titular character that was supposed to be Marvel’s next villain has now been fired?… We are only just beginning to see the ramifications of this disaster, and I am morbidly curious how it continues from here

50..  Fool's Paradise - Directed by Charlie Day: God dammit, Charlie. I love you because of IASIP... but i still don't know what this film was supposed to be, or if it was even supposed to be funny.

49.. Saltburn - Directed by Emerald Fennell: My brother had given me fair warning about the “content” of this movie before I went with him, my dad, and gf to see it. Since I loved PYW, I thought “How bad could it be?”… There are those that will love it, and there’s certainly substance there for those that do, but this was just an uncomfortable ride for me.

48.. Five Nights at Freddy’s - Directed by Emma Tammi - This is not a good film… but it’s also bad enough that it’s good/passable. For the generation that has grown up with the FNAF games, this is a good enough film to throw on at future sleepover parties and laugh at the absurdity.

47.. The Flash - Directed by Andres Muschetti: For all of the ""hype"" that was put behind this film, it is quite fascinating to reflect on my time in that near-empty IMAX theater and watch this disaster. It is a film that does try, and also ropes me in because of MK Batman, but it is also bloated, and making up for so much lost ground on the DCEU that if you're not into moviegoing, it's not going to be worth the time, especially with the incoming hard rest.

46.. Boys in the Boat - Directed by George Clooney: The direction and acting are strong, for a story that, to me at least, is pretty dull in scope. Most of the scenes are the races, but I'm not left feeling the weight of the victories and just how big these upsets were

45.. Cocaine Bear - Directed by Elizabeth Banks: This film was relatively entertaining, with some genuinely hilarious moments, but I also thought there were a lot of lulls in between, with a climax that was lacking. However, it is a fun last role to watch legendary Ray Liotta in. RIP

44.. Knock at the Cabin: Directed by M. Night Shyamalan: This will mostly/hopefully be known as Batista’s breakout role. Having been a longtime WWE fan, it’s been fun seeing his ascension, and he truly is the shining mark in an otherwise okay film by M. Night. Here’s to hoping this is the beginning of more leading roles for the man

43.. Beau is Afraid - Directed by Ari Aster: For those that did sit through this “experience”, there are only two words to sum up my thoughts on this film… Penis Monster 8=D.

42.. Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny - Directed by James Mangold: Indiana Jones is considered to be the greatest cinema icon according to the AFI’s current list… After this other middling installment, I admittedly doubt it will be the case if they poll again. This film is a lot better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but is still a far cry from Spielberg’s original three. And with a new generation of moviegoers coming of age, Indiana admittedly feels more mid-range because of these installments. The ending twist is pretty sweet, but it is a slog to get there, with too much dialogue, and not enough wit that I had come to know Indy for.

41.. The Hunger Games: BoSS - Directed by Francis Lawrence: A good beginning, fantastic Hunger Games, and what I thought was a pretty unearned third-act turn. As an added note, if there was a Hunger Games film just with Jason Schwartzman doing commentary, I'd buy a ticket.

40.. Napoleon - Directed by Ridley Scott: I enjoyed the action scenes whenever they occurred, but this movie was also everywhere and should’ve been more focused on why Napoleon was a defining historical figure. TL;DR Less woofing, more battle cries.

39.. Priscilla - Directed by Sofia Coppola: An interesting and more grounded take on the music legend, that shows a bit of those darker shades of The King that not many want to discuss.

38.. A Man Called Otto - Directed by Marc Forster: If they are ever to make a live-action version of Up, Tom Hanks should play Carl. He pretty much does a scaled version of him in this endearing movie of a grumpy man, with a deep backstory worth investing in. A nice film to put on during a random weekend with nothing to do.

37.. M3GAN - Directed by Gerard Johnstone: This is a “sleepover” film done right. It is a B-horror movie that does not take itself too seriously, which makes it better as a result. I am hoping the sequel can be given an R-rating just to add to the insanity.

36.. Asteroid City - Directed by Wes Anderson: I am admittedly a sucker for Wes Anderson so this film might be higher as a result. It is a funny film, but also confusing since it is intertwining between two stories. A point that is even used as a joke during the film.

35.. Gran Turismo - Directed by Neil Blomkamp: For those that are aware of Neil’s filmography, he kind of needed this W. It is a film that you can guess the ending of, but will still watch because of the strong performances and action from everyone involved.

34.. Scream VI - Directed by Tyler Gillett, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin: Some BIG kills take place in the BIG apple. I’m not sure where the franchise goes from here, so if this is it? It was a fun way to go out, with some innovative kills courtesy of the NYC setting.

33.. Missing - Directed by Will Merrick, Nick Johnson: This is the sequel to the breakout hit “Searching”, and it is a decent and tense follow-up on an interesting concept where the entire film takes place on a screen. I’m not sure how many more can be made, but if it can be done, I’d love to see more.

32.. Blue Beetle - Directed by Angel Manuel Soto: An unfortunate “victim” of “CBM fatigue”. Blue Beetle isn’t breaking any new ground, but what it does do a good job of is dialing it back and focusing on a grounded and contained origin story of a boy, his power,  how he utilizes it for good, and a beetle that eats his face. Xolo and George make it worth a watch

31.. The Marvels - Directed by Mia DaCosta: Another “victim” is The Marvels. I went in expecting to dislike this film, and it’s possibly because the bar was so low that I wound up enjoying it. It’s not the most memorable Marvel film, but it's a tight 100 minutes that are at least upheld by the chemistry between the three leads.30.

30.. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1 - Directed by Christopher McQuarrie: I was admittedly not expecting to have this film ranked so low. It is a good time, but is also defined by very long action sequences where you know the conclusion will end with the text “TBC”. It is always awesome watching insane stunts, but it feels less impactful when it’s only “Part 1”.

29.. Joy Ride - Directed by Adele Lim: So full disclosure, I saw this with my gf’s parents and brother who expected this to be a “family film”. When they showed the devil horn tattoo, it had to be one of my favorite movie experiences this year. It is a raunchy good time. Just don't see it with parents who are not comfortable with that.

28.. No Hard Feelings - Directed by Gene Stupnitsky: A film my gf’s parents probably would’ve appreciated more. Another fun comedy that does a nice job of giving a slight new spin on the “coming of age” experience all teenagers go through.

27.. Strays - Directed by Josh Greenbaum: This was so much funnier than I was honestly expecting. This is a good time for anyone, but dog/animal lovers will fall in love with this movie.

26.. Dicks: The Musical - Directed by Larry Charles: Maybe the preparation and forewarning helped for this one because I thought this film was a pretty hilarious time despite how offensive it was. One other couple was in the theater and walked out in protest just before Bowen Yang concluded the movie. Great time.

25.. Creed III - Directed by Michael B. Jordan: Incredibly strong directorial debut for Michael B. Jordan, who utilizes and breaks new ground on a beloved character that we thought we already knew the full story of.

24.. Fast X - Directed by Louis Leterrier: As much as I love character studies using boxing as a medium, I also love big explosions and fast cars that go vrooooom. And this movie is full of it. It’s an F&F all-star lineup featuring FU’s/AA’s, exploding reservoirs, and flying kids!

23.. Dumb Money - Directed by Craig Gillespie: If you loved The Big Short, you will also like this movie and how a couple of apes were able to game the system. You won’t admittedly learn as much as TBS, but you will still enjoy watching the 1% shit themselves while Paul Dano eats his tendies. 💎🤲🏻

22.. Dream Scenario - Directed by Kristoffer Borgli: Nicholas Cage takes on a more subdued character in one of my favorite roles I’ve seen from him. He is both charming and creepy at the same time, which is hard to pull off. While the ending has a bit to be desired, sometimes it can be ok when some things are left unsaid.

21.. Air - Directed by Ben Affleck: It’s difficult to think now, but there was a time before Michael Jordan. With an all-star cast in tow, Air does a good job covering that story from the perspective of the few people who knew what Air Jordan would become

20.. Poor Things - Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos: I didn’t expect a movie with a plot involving a woman with a baby brain attaining enlightenment through sex to be so endearing. Emma shines in this role and also bares it all in another defining performance to add to the actress’s astounding filmography. Oh, did I mention that Willem, Ruffalo, and Ramy also pull in strong performances of their own?

19.. BlackBerry - Directed by Matt Johnson: What’s more fun than watching a company succeed against the odds? A company imploding. The world's cell phones today are defined by Apple and Android. Before 2007? It was the BlackBerry. Watching the monumental rise and collapse of a company that was once so popular people used it in their everyday language was an incredibly fun time. ESPECIALLY once the Storm was introduced. As someone who once owned that phone, it was surreal seeing that junk again and remembering it existed.

18.. Thanksgiving - Directed by Eli Roth: This has to be my favorite movie directed by Eli, which doesn’t say too much given his niche genre, but man is he working at his best here. This is B-level horror going in full gear. The kills are innovative and gruesome, the backstory is silly but believable, and the characters work perfectly in the story. I hope there is room for 2nds

17.. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves - Directed by Jonathan Goldsetin, John Francis Daley: My biggest surprise on this list. I am not a D&D person, and doubt I ever will. So to enjoy this film as much as I did was a genuine surprise. It was hilarious and full of heart. You could see the love for the material coming off of each actor. It didn’t do well in the BO so it might be a while, but I hope a sequel can be done someday.

16.. Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 - Directed by James Gunn: The only CBM to “hit” this year, and a possible blueprint for the future direction of Marvel. This was possibly the darkest MCU film I’ve seen, with the most compelling villain that they’ve had in a while. Whatever the next Avengers film is in the future, my suggestion is to at least bring back the “High Evolutionary” in some form.

15.. Saw X - Directed by Kevin Greutert: If you would’ve honestly told me that the 10th installment in this franchise would EASILY be the best since the first, there’s no way I would’ve believed you. What sets Saw X apart from its predecessors is that this time, you feel compelled to watch the people play in Jigsaw’s games. And boy are they as gruesome as ever. Legitimately fainted on my girlfriend during one of the games.

14.. Renfield - Directed by Chris McKay: This bombed badly and admittedly got some flack as a result, but I thought this was the perfect mix of laughs, gore, and action. The fact that the film is also only 85 minutes helps it significantly. It is a breeze to watch, and a lot of fun too. Especially getting to see Cage play Dracula.

13.. Theater Camp - Directed by Molly Gordon, Nick Lieberman: If you’ve ever been to a summer camp, or participated in school plays, this film can hit incredibly close to home. A very sweet coming-of-age tale for a lot of the actors, with really strong performances from Jimmy Tatro and Benjamin Platt. I also loved some of the brief cameos too. Clocking at 85 minutes, it is also a breezy film that left me feeling uplifted by the end.

12.. Super Mario Bros. - Directed by Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic: If this is the beginning of the “video game boom”, then this film will probably be looked back on as the one that kickstarted it. And how appropriate is it that it’s everyone’s favorite plumber? The outdated film from 1993 is given completely new updates in a film that would make any fan of the video game feel compelled to pick up and play it again. It is a rare 4-quadrant movie that hits all of the right nostalgic notes and has me excited for more.

11.. TMNT: Mutant Mayhem - Directed by Jeff Rowe: Playing MOP’s “Ante Up” in a family film… I never knew just how much I wanted that until I saw it. This is an incredibly mature and heartwarming film despite it being for families. Jeff allowed the four actors who played the TMNT to record their lines together to help with the chemistry. And it does make a huge difference in how genuine the movie feels. Mix in some crazy mutants, and some genuinely awesome action sequences, and this film falls just outside of my top 10 for the year.

10.. Talk to Me - Directed by Danny and Michael Philippou: As someone who is a sucker for a good horror movie, rarely does one come out that has me audibly yelling, gasping, squirming, and cringing. For once, the reviews in the trailer about how gruesome this movie was weren’t far off. To me, it was unsettling, shocking, and genuinely horrifying. I will be curious how the sequel ups the ante.

9.. The Iron Claw - Directed by Sean Durkin: I am a huge pro-wrestling fan. I truly admire this borderline “underground” world where men and women are willing to legitimately hurt each other and risk their lives, all for the sake of money and entertainment. My favorite movie is The Wrestler, and The Iron Claw is now easily my 2nd favorite. And with good reason. The story of The Von Erichs is one of true heartbreak and tragedy because of how malicious their dad was. And it is shown, blade cuts and all, in a very raw and depressing movie that is anchored by Zac Efron’s strongest in his career to date. It would be a long shot for him to win, but I do hope he’s nominated for Best Actor. His portrayal of Kevin was heartbreaking and endearing.

8.. Godzilla - Minus One - Directed by Takashi Yamazaki: This movie has been making waves on social media so I’ll just reiterate. If you haven’t seen this movie yet. See it. See it on the biggest screen you can if it’s possible. Godzilla has never been so god damn awesome and terrifying. It is also one of the rare Godzilla films where the human element enhances the film as a whole. It is a long shot as well, but I would hope this movie is nominated at the Academy for BP. It is that good of a film.

7.. The Holdovers - Directed by Alexander Payne: While epic stakes certainly do a good job of conveying a theme or story, small scale can do just as well. This is such an amusing and thoughtful dark comedy that just happens to take place on Christmas. And the film soars because of the chemistry between the three leads, and especially between Paul and Dominic. By the end, you can’t help but root and empathize with all of the leads, and their struggles.

6.. Killers of the Flower Moon - Directed by Martin Scorsese: America. It’s uglier than people want to realize or admit. And Marty wants you to know that in KotFM. A cerebral tale that is as fucked up as it is fascinating. Once you get past the awe of DeNiro and Leo acting with each other, you are then terrified for Lily’s well-being for well over half of this movie. And considering the weight of history that she is lifting for her people, it would be hard not to admire her work put into this movie. This film admittedly taught me a lot about just how sinister conspirers are willing to go to “stay” on top, how subtly they’ll do it, and how wide-ranging it is.

5.. Past Lives- Directed by Celine Song: As indie as I’d say an indie film gets. The budget was over $12 million, but could’ve honestly been mistaken for a smaller budget. What sells this film is the universal element and experience of love and how a big part of it comes down to timing/fate. In the midst of this, the film also does an amazing job of touching on themes such as culture, identity, and support in beautifully subtle ways that have you surprisingly intertwined in each character’s life by the time the ending is reached.

4.. Spiderman: Across the SpiderVerse - Directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson: it’s rare for a movie to be over 2 hours long, and when I read “TBC” I audibly say “What the fuck?! NO! Keep going!” This is animation at its very peak. So much care and animation styles were put into this film. I am crossing my fingers hard that BTSV can stick the landing so this trilogy can be championed as one of the best-animated film series ever.

3.. John Wick: Chapter IV - Directed by Chad Stahelski: I will admit, I am a huge sucker for action heroes like “Jason Bourne” and “James Bond”, and in my time, the only person that I think could keep up with Jason is John fucking Wick. And this is John Wick at his most brutal yet. The action is insane, the violence is ultra, and some of the sequences are truly mind-blowing, with techniques that I’ve never seen in film before. It’s probably my most controversial choice since I could see why others would think it was too long, but for my money, that was pretty much 3-hours well spent.

2.. Barbie - Directed by Greta Gerwig: I want to predicate that the final 2 on this list are partially biased, but I would say also stand on their own. As a backstory, I turned 30 on July 18th, and have admittedly been struggling mentally/financially a lot of my life. If you had told me at the beginning of this year how things would turn out, I likely would’ve become more depressed because I just didn’t believe good things were meant to happen in my life while I found my footing. As a cinephile, Barbenheimer is my personal “Woodstock” moment. The perfect amount of forces outside of my control led to the best moviegoing night of my life. I went with friends and cosplayed as scientists to complete Barbenheimer at the Lincoln Square AMC. When we walked into the room, it is a literal sea of pink. Everyone is wearing pink shirts, pink cowboy hats, pink cowboy suits, pink pants... All Pink Everything. We get to our seats in a packed theater, and the whole room is just buzzing with positive vibes and energy. So much so that I cracked a joke before the film and got people to laugh along.

And it’s with good reason too. This is a very touching, funny, heartwarming, and empowering film, that also happens to do a fabulous job at product placement, creating a new legion of Barbie fans. What the movie does best is that it subverts the expectations of what we’ve come to expect when we think about Barbie, and reinvents the wheel to show just how much of a feminine icon Barbie is, and how much she means to generations of women who grew up with the doll. This movie is another strong performance from Margot, which is also supported by a hilarious Ryan Gosling who reminds us all how as men, we're just Ken, and that’s also just enough :). This film should hopefully lead to some well-deserved nominations come the Academies, and also lead to blank checks for Greta so she can direct whatever project she wants.

&#x200B;

1.. Oppenheimer - Directed by Christopher Nolan: To finish our night, we wound up being the first people to see the 70MM IMAX print/showing of Oppenheimer due to an exhaust malfunction that occurred before the 7:30 pm show. Before the film, we were given special 70 MM film strips with some of the images from the movie (I will someday have a framed between the film, and a photo of my friends and I holding it between Barbie and Oppenheimer posters).

In addition, I love Christopher Nolan, and I love learning about WWII. For myself, I think the atomic bomb might be the most significant invention mankind has ever created, and a story about The Manhattan Project would be worth showing on a movie screen. However, I genuinely never thought it was possible due to the subject that the movie would cover. If a film like this were to ever be made, my five personal choices on who could direct an effective film were Del Toro, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, Spielberg, and Nolan, with Nolan being my 1st choice above all.

So with all of that, my expectations were probably the highest that they’ve ever been and ever will be, for a movie. And Nolan hit every mark and stuck the landing. The message was simple, but so fucking effective and haunting. If we as a species aren’t careful… We’re Fucked. And we very well could already be. Nolan uses every one of his tropes to perfection, while also completely subverting expectations in the process, making you feel mesmerized at how you walked in expecting one film, and came out with an entirely different experience. As a Nolan fanboy, I do hope this is his moment, and he finally wins an Oscar for Best Director, as well as Best Picture. I hope the same for Cillian as well for Best Actor, but both remain to be seen, and there is quite some competition for the upcoming Oscars.

&#x200B;

Additional Note:

\- In addition to this I also saw 3 re-releases this year and one film that I believe was only shown at festivals: Titanic 3D, Stop Making Sense, Robot Dreams, and Nightmare Before Christmas. Making it a total of 58 films I saw in a theater this year.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I can’t recall a time when I felt there were so many deserving nominees, but I guess that’s what also happens when you go to as many films as I did. While the industry finds itself currently in the throes, this was a very good year for moviegoing, and I only hope 2024 can be just as strong. I hope you enjoyed reading this, as much as I did getting to create this ranking list, write these mini-reviews, and reflect on the year of 2023 in movies. I'd love to read and comment on some personal favorites that you might've had as well so feel free to discuss any part of the list that you agree or disagree with.",1567,0.79,2023-12-28 16:43:14,553
Why Dead Reckoning was a drop in quality...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mission_Impossible/comments/18t0wtk/why_dead_reckoning_was_a_drop_in_quality/,"I think Dead Reckoning was quite unfortunate in terms of its box office flop because of Barbenheimer, but at the same time, I also feel like it was also the result of the director refusing to make an actual screenplay of the movie before filming, which is what caused a lot of mishaps. I genuinely think with Fallout, it was a masterpiece because we were lucky the movie made no mistakes. This movie did, and a lot could have been avoided if they took the time to make the screenplay before filming. So what are these mistakes?

I also want to mention before any unnecessary hate that I do love this movie, and this franchise, which is why I want it to succeed, I just wish Mcquarry and Cruise become better prepared next time. 

&#x200B;

Ilsa's Death:

This is a big one, and is notorious as a mistake, so I'll get it done quickly, because you guys probably already share the same thoughts. Apart from her death being used as an obvious case of fridging, it also doesn't make sense in terms of Gabriel's skill. For half the movie, he has done nothing but stay on the sidelines, and then to suddenly kill off Ilsa, who we know has one of the strongest characters in the franchise, it just doesn't work, it makes her death feel all the more unfair. It also doesn't help how she is replaced by Grace who is completely underdeveloped as a character, I will explain more about her later. 

&#x200B;

The villain(s): 

Another big one. Both Gabriel and The Entity were stuck on the sidelines the entire movie. Gabriel is especially done incorrect as his casting completely contradicts his aforementioned character. He is referred by Ilsa as this dark messiah as a gift for the world to share but when we actually see him in the movie, he is anything but. He has the charisma of a warm dad, comforting in nature, I have to blame this on bad acting. It also doesn't help that Pom's character fits more in this role, as she encapsulates the cold ruthless nature more. The Entity itself was only introduced halfway into filming, which introduces all sorts of problems which I will get into.

&#x200B;

Grace:

No disrespect to Hayley Atwell, I really think she played her role great here. It's just that the role was terrible. The character had next to no motivation, which made her an annoyance for Ethan, which is especially irritating when Ethan simps over Grace the entire movie, handling her as if she is just a pretty brunette that has to be protected. The treatment of female characters was quite bad in this. If she had the motivation of, let's say her younger sister was terminally ill and coming from a poor family, she has to pay for expenses to treat her sister, it would work really well and not too much of the movie would have to change. Now, we have a character who is desperate and is forced to betray Ethan, which would justify Ethan's excessive sympathy over her. Instead, we just get a greedy character who Ethan falls in love with, and treats as a delicacy, it just doesn't work, and annoys the male audience who have to tolerate Ethan getting betrayed by her three times just to save her again. Not even joking.

&#x200B;

The dialogue:

Cristopher Mcquarry is one of the best action directors, but he is completely wrong in his ideology that audiences have to sit through boring monologues and dialogue to get to the fun action. It's wrong. Learning information should be through action, drama or tension, which this movie does sometimes and it works great, but having to sit through 12 minute dialogue scenes are inexcusable. The problem is that it had to be done, because the Entity was only added halfway through production, which shows the problem that the director unnecessarily faces when he could just create a well thought out screenplay beforehand.

&#x200B;

The action:

Now before you go haywire, the action overall was great, but it didn't compare to Fallout and JW4. I'm sorry to say it, but after Fallout, The Raid and especially John Wick 4, there was a new bar set on how action should be and Dead Reckoning didn't reach it. Like I said, the action was great, but a major step down from Fallout. The train fight against Gabriel had way too many cuts that made the action feel clunky and unsmooth. The chase scene in Italy was simply poorly paced. I don't mind a long action beat, like JW4, but the difference is that this action scene introduced no new mechanics as the action went off apart from more people chasing them and having to sit in an uncontrollable car while handcuffed. Which is fine, but it doesn't blend well with the environment, and it also contradicts with the overall solemn tone and finality of the mission, when we see people doing doughnuts and making quippy jokes on how Italians park, we forget that this mission is supposed to be serious. The club fight doesn't take advantage of where it is and its environment, so it just makes its action average. Ilsa's death is just stupid for reasons we have covered. However, the opening sandstorm shootout, alley fight and train escape all took advantage of its environment and were amazing action sequences, on par with some of John Wick's fights. That's how action should be done. Had all of the action had the quality of those three, this complaint wouldn't be here.

&#x200B;

The lack of stunts: 

Don't get me wrong. The jump was incredible, but having been forced to watch promotional material of this movie before it released, there should have been more to the jump. We should have seen Ethan trying to guide his parachute through mountain terrain as he attempts to land on the train. Think of the Halo Jump in Fallout, it was multi-layered. There were steps to it. Jump. Save Walker. Activate both parachutes. Land in right location. Instead we just got Ethan randomly crashing through the exact carriage at the exact location at the exact time needed to save Grace's life. Plot inconvenience at its finest. When Mcquarry filmed the train sequence, there was literally no screenplay, so he didn't have a clue what to do here, which is why he got backed into a corner and had to have Ethan conveniently save Grace, because the movie required it. Ruined immersion completely. The other issue is that this was the only stunt in the film. Fallout had about 4: The halo jump, the rooftop chase, the helicopter fight, etc. This movie had only one. It feels underwhelming compared to Fallout. 

&#x200B;

The overall plot:

It is just downright unacceptable how the entire plot of the movie can be summarised into Ethan gets the key and the location of an area he needs to go to next movie. It especially doesn't help how we already know the location 2 minutes into the movie, so we have to tolerate 2.5 hours of Ethan playing catchup and the fact that he already had half of the key 30 minutes into the movie. This movie is so unnecessarily bloated for its own good, and it's only half of the movie. Again, John Wick 4 did it better by stuffing 2 movies into one without it being bloated. Oppenheimer did it better. They also missed the mark on the key. It should be representative of something close to Ethan, because otherwise it's just yet another displaceable McGuffin that mocks Infinity War's Avenger Stones, which handled it better, because they are actually symbolic of sacrifice, pain etc, which Thanos has to overcome and go through to achieve his task. 

&#x200B;

Being a Part 1:

There are a few cases where being a Part 1 works: Dune, Infinity War, heck even John Wick 2, even though it's a sequel. What all of these have in common is that the central task is resolved, and the Part 2 comes from the protagonist(s) having to deal with the consequences of them winning or losing. Dead Reckoning believes that giving itself a climatic setpiece justifies being a Part 1 even though the main conflict isn't resolved. And it fails hard. 

&#x200B;

Outro:

I have more minute issues with the film, but I feel like I've rambled on enough and have gave the key points out. I really hope McQuarry realise the scope of his mistakes and aim to address them when he makes Mission Impossible 8, which I already feel has been partially ruined by the fact that it's a Part 2 meaning it's all payoff and no setup, meaning it's incomplete.

&#x200B;

Again, I want to reiterate that I love this movie, but I could have loved it more, had these issues been addressed. And if you think Dead Reckoning is the best in the series, then great, I envy you, but it's really not. To me, it's overshadowed by 4-6. 

&#x200B;

If you actually read all of this, then you have my respect, because there was a lot there to read.

Bye.

硅谷银行的倒闭、萨姆·班克曼-弗里德的定罪、工会力量的复兴以及OpenAI的动荡都不过是今年发生的无数重大商业事件的之一。


“交易录”精选了2023年一些最重要新闻人物、事件和趋势的图片。


全球竞相监管人工智能


今年的人工智能发展十分红火。投资涌入了人工智能初创企业；凭借规模和云计算业务，科技巨头都与人工智能领域的新兴领头羊建立了联系；由于对人工智能半导体的需求增加，英伟达成了首家市值达1万亿美元的芯片制造商。


投资者有多热情，立法者就有多担忧，他们往往难以跟上开发这项技术的企业的步伐。但制定人工智能监管法规的第一步已经迈出。10月，拜登总统发布了[一项行政命令](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/hn-9oxDz52Oygb2qdDChAA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRnUvFZP0TJaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8zMC91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9iaWRlbi1haS1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9MCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ka18yMDIzMTIwNiZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0wJm5sPWRlYWxib29rJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTAmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPTVmMWQzYmEwNGIyODZmMjkzZjVhOTRhZmQwYTdiZDJhVwNueXRCCmVpWWxwZSdca2tSGXNhcmFoLmtlc3NsZXJAbnl0aW1lcy5jb21YBAAAAAM~)，重点关注该技术对国家安全的影响；中国对某些类型的人工智能施加了限制；欧盟立法者则通过了全球最早的[人工智能监管制度](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ZvT_XbL24M92JMVvGCKzLQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRnVupYP0TbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wOC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2V1LWFpLWFjdC1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9NCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ka18yMDIzMTIwOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0xMDk3MDcmbmw9ZGVhbGJvb2smcmVnaV9pZD0xNjI1NTMzOTQmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xNTIxNjEmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPTVmMWQzYmEwNGIyODZmMjkzZjVhOTRhZmQwYTdiZDJhVwNueXRCCmVzWGV0ZXxXxBtSGXNhcmFoLmtlc3NsZXJAbnl0aW1lcy5jb21YBAAAAAM~)之一。


虽然监管方式各异，但也存在推动某种程度的国际合作的努力。上个月，来自20多个国家——包括作为竞争对手的中美——的科技高管和研究人员参加了在英国举行的人工智能安全峰会。该峰会并未出台新的监管规则，但各国政府都对[最先进人工智能系统带来的危险发出了警示](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/europe/uk-ai-summit-sunak.html)，并就继续对话达成一致。


PGA巡回赛和LIV高尔夫联赛同意合并


PGA巡回赛是世界顶级男子职业高尔夫巡回赛，而沙特投资的LIV高尔夫联赛是正在挖角顶级球手并对前者构成严重威胁的竞争对手，双方于6月6日初步[达成了合并协议](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/sports/golf/pga-liv-golf-merger.html)。这一决定对PGA巡回赛及其总裁杰伊·莫纳汉来说是令人震惊的反转，再加上协商过程的秘而不宣，激怒了许多PGA巡回赛的顶级球手。


该协议凸显了[沙特阿拉伯在体育商业领域日益增长的实力](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/09/business/dealbook/tennis-business-saudi-arabia.html)。作为推动其依赖石油的经济实现多样化的部分努力，沙特在[足球](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/sports/soccer/saudi-pro-league-tv.html)、[拳击](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/24/sports/fury-paul-fight-saudi.html)和高尔夫项目上投入巨资。但许多人指出了沙特阿拉伯糟糕的人权纪录，对该协议的逻辑提出质疑。[美国议员](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/sports/golf/pga-tour-liv-saudi-senate-hearing.html)想知道沙特政府是否正在利用体育作为一种“体育洗白”的手段来推进其战略目标。


“芭本海默”主宰票房


在7月同一天上映的两部电影带来了人们期待已久的信号，表明影市已从疫情中复苏。[《芭比》](https://cn.nytimes.com/film-tv/20230725/barbie-movie-review/)(Barbie)是一部以美泰玩偶为主角的喜剧片，由格蕾塔·葛韦格执导。由克里斯托弗·诺兰执导的[《奥本海默》](https://cn.nytimes.com/film-tv/20230724/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan/)(Oppenheimer)是讲述原子弹创造者生平的传记片。[这两部影片](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/business/barbie-oppenheimer-weekend-box-office.html)为北美影市带来了自2019年4月[《复仇者联盟4：终局之战》](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/movies/avengers-endgame-box-office.html)(Avengers: Endgame)上映以来票房最高的周末。一些影迷甚至选择连看两场。


在这两部影片上映之际，美国编剧工会和代表了数万名演员的演员工会-美国电视和广播艺人联合会（SAG-AFTRA，简称演员工会）都在罢工，导致这个影视行业——以及[对热门影视接连上演的期待](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/movies/barbenheimer-strike.html)——几乎陷入停滞。9月，编剧工会[与电影公司达成协议](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/25/business/media/hollywood-writers-strike-deal.html#:~:text=On%20Day%20146%2C%20Screenwriters%20Reach,Hollywood%20will%20remain%20shut%20down.&text=Hollywood's%20bitter%2C%20monthslong%20labor%20dispute,first%20step%20toward%20a%20resolution.)，演员工会[在11月也达成了协议](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/media/actors-strike-deal.html#:~:text=SAG%2DAFTRA%2C%20the%20union%20representing,to%20swing%20back%20into%20motion.)。


区域性银行倒闭引发危机


3月10日，政府接管了硅谷银行，这是[自2008年金融危机以来最为严重的银行倒闭](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230315/silicon-valley-bank-gregory-becker/)事件。简要回顾如下：该银行财务陷入困境和穆迪下调其债券评级的消息传出后，受到惊吓的客户抢兑了超过400亿美元的存款。3月12日，监管机构关闭了总部位于纽约的签名银行。


这些银行的倒闭引发了外界对于其他中型银行稳定性的担忧。华尔街最大的几家银行同意向[第一信托银行提供300亿美元](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/business/first-republic-bank-sale.html)的资金，瑞士当局也促成了瑞士银行[收购](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/business/ubs-credit-suisse.html)其国内竞争对手瑞信银行的交易。但如此大手笔的干预也不足以挽救第一信托银行：联邦监管机构于5月接管该银行，并将其[出售给摩根大通](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-bank-jpmorgan.html)。


美国汽车工人联合会的历史性罢工


9月14日，美国汽车工人联合会开始了第一波罢工，[同时对抗底特律三大汽车制造商](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/business/uaw-strike-plan.html)：通用汽车、福特汽车以及的公羊、吉普和克莱斯勒的母公司斯特兰蒂斯。工会打破了在某一家企业进行大规模或全部停工的传统办法，而是选择在各家企业的少数厂址发起罢工。六周后，劳方与三家企业[达成初步协议](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/business/economy/gm-uaw-contract-deal.html)，让工人获得了数十年来最大幅的涨薪，同时也避免了旷日持久的停工。此番成功也让汽车工人联合会将矛头指向了[非工会车企](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/business/uaw-union-organizing.html#:~:text=At%20the%20DealBook%20Summit%20conference,have%20an%20adversarial%20relationship%E2%80%9D%20between)，包括特斯拉和外资企业。


泰勒·斯威夫特征服全球


泰勒·斯威夫特呈现其整个音乐生涯作品的“时代巡回演唱会”在今年一鸣惊人，据一项估计，该演唱会每场门票收入达到1400万美元，[到明年巡演结束时](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/05/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour.html)，总销售额有望超过14亿美元。斯威夫特在7月打破了[排行榜冠军专辑最多的女歌手纪录](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/arts/music/taylor-swift-speak-now-billboard-chart-record.html)，她还为自己的演唱会电影开创了[新商业思路](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/business/dealbook/how-beyonce-and-taylor-swift-struck-a-new-kind-of-movie-deal.html)。她直接与连锁院线AMC娱乐协商发行影片《泰勒·斯威夫特：时代巡回演唱会》(Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour)。这让她得以绕过大制片公司，保留57%的票房收入。在该片10月开画的首周末，其北美院线的三天总票房估计达到9500万到9700万美元，[轻松成为有史以来票房最高的演唱会电影](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/business/media/taylor-swift-eras-movie-box-office.html)。


萨姆·班克曼-弗里德被定罪


11月2日，经过四个小时的审议，陪审团裁定FTX加密货币交易所创始人萨姆·班克曼-弗里德的[七项罪名成立](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/technology/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-trial-ftx.html)，这些罪名指控他用欺诈和阴谋手段从客户及投资者处窃取了数十亿美元的资产。班克曼-弗里德在一片讶然中跌落神坛，他曾是加密货币行业的榜样人物，仅仅一年前还坐拥200亿美元的身价。FTX破产后，许多最亲密的副手和高管都同意与检方合作对他进行指证。在纽约的一场审判中，他被描绘成一个肆无忌惮的年轻创始人，将偷来的钱转移到私人投资里，并且挥霍无度。


现年31岁的班克曼-弗里德预计将提起上诉。他的量刑定于2024年3月28日进行。


美国企业在中国面临新压力


上个月，在旧金山附近举行的亚太领导人峰会期间，拜登总统与中国领导人习近平进行了一年多以来的首次面对面会晤。双方与会氛围友好，旨在重新建立起沟通渠道。


但习近平在访美期间还试图安抚美国商界领袖。他[为企业高管举办了一场晚宴](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20231117/china-us-business-xi-jinping-ceos/ ""Link: https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20231117/china-us-business-xi-jinping-ceos/"")。出席者包括苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克、贝莱德首席执行官拉里·芬克，以及黑石集团主席苏世民。尽管在西方关联企业受到打压且中美关系紧张之际，在华经营的挑战愈发艰巨，习近平仍欲传达中国欢迎外企的信号。而这场晚宴表明，许多美国企业[还没打算放弃在华业务](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230911/china-us-business/)。


埃隆·马斯克痛斥放弃X的广告商


埃隆·马斯克在11月29日的“交易录峰会”上引发[轩然大波](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/01/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-tesla-spacex.html)，因他对那些在他支持反犹阴谋论后[暂停在X平台投放广告的企业](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/business/dealbook/elon-musk-advertisers-blackmail-iger.html)破口大骂。他还说自己并非有意支持偏见，并为自己的帖子道歉。在这段90分钟的采访中，拥有SpaceX、特斯拉和X这些全球最重要也最受关注的企业的亿万富豪马斯克还谈到了他的个人哲学、他对人工智能的担忧、以及2024年总统大选。",2,1,2023-12-28 2:58:13,1

Top 10 Worst Commercials Of 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialsIHate/comments/18qra1b/top_10_worst_commercials_of_2023/,"Happy Holidays People. It was an interesting year. There was the whole Barbenheimer thing, Taylor swift started dating Travis Kelce, we said hello to AI generated stuff, and it was the 10th anniversary of this sub. Personally, I hated 2023, but it’s not about that. A few days ago was my 1 Year Anniversary of being apart of this sub. It was great to join a community of redditors who hated the same dumbass commercials that I have, and as we step into 2024, we want to forget some of the terrible ads from the year so we can have new terrible ads to hate on. I proudly present the Top 10 Worst Commercials Of 2023.

&#x200B;

**Number 10:Planet Fitness Low Energy Commercial**

If you seen the first ad where the dude with the balloon says “I can’t even blow this little guy” then you know what I’m talking about. First of all, in a way, these commercials were weird as hell, not to mention the weird sex jokes like half way through the commercial. I don’t know who came up with this but that person was just begging for this ad to get ridiculed on the internet. I bet people that saw this and went “Ayo! What did he just say?!” If I had to describe it in one word: ridiculous.

&#x200B;

**Number 9:Samsung Galaxy ”Horror Story“ Commercial**

Before you come at me for not giving this shitty ad a higher ranking, let me explain. This has to be one of the dumbest ads of the year. I’m not sure what’s so scary about a freaking android phone, besides that goddamn jingle(you know the one) but the one thing I hate about this ad is that one girls facial expression when staring at the phone, then the other actors run away like a bunch of idiots. I don’t know what Samsung was trying to accomplish but they failed miserably. This is exactly why almost no one uses android phones.

**Number 8:Paxlovid**

Every Sunday, I’m sitting on my couch watching NASCAR Cup Series race and in almost every other commercial break I’m seeing this fucking ad. They not showing this ad that much anymore but, that doesn’t mean that there might be another one in the foreseeable future. Surprisingly, I can’t think about what else I hate about this ad, but it was just playing nonstop and im pretty sure most of you saw this ad in like every commercial break. That’s pretty much it.

**Number 7:Sotyktu**

Again, I know that most of you think that this commercial deserves a higher ranking, so do I, but just let me riff. This is one of the most hated commercials of the year. And it’s because of one specific scene: That dude walking around in a Speedo and is then seen by his daughter. Personally, this has gotta be the weirdest, most perviest thing to ever happen in a commercial. At this point, pharmaceutical commercials should be illegal.

&#x200B;

**Number 6:Target Holiday Commercial**

I had to rank this commercial over Sotyktu because this commercial is the bane of my existence. First of all, the music in this ad is loud as hell. It makes my ears bleed to the point where I want to rip them off my head. Second, this is very much like target to make an ad like this. They had a commercial with this little girl that played soccer among other things. You know what I hated about it. The music. I shop at target almost all the time, but stop blasting that loud ass music in your ads, or else you’ll have to deal with me.

&#x200B;

**NOW… THE TOP 5**

https://i.redd.it/rdilsabmph8c1.gif

&#x200B;

**Number 5:Natasha Lyonne and Old Navy**

For years, Old Navy has been making the most terrible commercials known to man. We all remember last year’s terrible commercial with Jennifer Coolidge. And that commercial was… unbearable. This years ad with Natasha Lyonne doesn’t top last last years ad as the absolute worst. But I’d say the terribleness and this ad is very equivalent to last years ad. Theres 2 commercials where she meets a clone of herself and theres a commercial where she lugs a ton of Christmas presents with a toboggan that she stole from some little kid. Honestly, fuck old navy. I’m praying they don’t air a new years ad, but we all know I’m lying.

&#x200B;

**Number 4:Claritin playing a GODDAMN CHRISTMAS SONG**

Today is basically the only day that commercial becomes relevant, cause having to see this during spring and summer was a pain. Today is Christmas, and  we were having having to see this commercial in like June and July. They butchered a classic holiday song and I’m just as tired of this ad as all of you are. The only thing that Claritin is known for was being on the car that Carl Edwards was driving when he flipped into the catch fence at Talladega in 2009. Where my NASCAR fans at? Anyway, I have a strong feeling that we’re gonna see this ad next year.

&#x200B;

**Number 3:Verizon Holiday Commercial**

If this commercial isn’t gonna take the top spot, it should at least get a spot in the top 3. This has gotta be one of the worst holiday commercials of all time. Verizon has been pretty insufferable throughout the year. I’m not sure if they have low sales and they trying to make us buy the phones that they’re selling or if they’re intentionally trying to make terrible ads and laugh their asses off when they see our reactions. Probably something like “HAHAHA! LOOK AT THIS GUY!  HE‘S SO MAD, ITS HILARIOUS!!!”  I know I’m not the only guy who thinks Covid made commercials worse but I believe that this should be a example of that.

&#x200B;

**Number 2:Jardiance:The Musical!**

I’m surprised I didn’t rank this at number one cause this ad was annoying as hell. This commercial has marked its territory as one of the most terrible commercials of 2023. I refuse to step foot into 2024 and have this 60 second piece o’ crap on my tv screen. I wanna know who directed this ad so I can let that person know that they’re responsible for single handedly creating one of the worst commercials of all time. This is why I hate pharmaceutical commercials. There annoying and dumb.

**AND NOW…**

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/or9uvhe85i8c1.gif

**Number One:Amazon Mustache Girl Commercial**

You should now know why some of the ads on this list weren’t number one, cause none of those commercials , hell, not ANY COMMERCIAL IN EXISTENCE WAS AS BAD AS THIS. We were forced to watch this garbaggio during Super Bowl 57, then it was playing during every commercial break on every channel. This is like the Logan Paul of commercials:it never shuts up. This was an eerily similar feeling to the infamous Grubhub commercial from 2021. It was on during every commercial and it was on every channel, of every hour, of every day. I really hope we never see anything like this again because if we do, I might as well become Kai Cenat(Im pretty sure you understand the reference)

**Heres a few Dishonorable Mentions:**

BOT: The Color Purple targeting $16M+ Christmas opening day. Severe supply constraints are likely placing a ~$22M ceiling on TCP's opening day. High demand and limited supply may give TCP the most crowded opening day/previews (as % of seats available) since Spider-Man: No Way Home.,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18part6/bot_the_color_purple_targeting_16m_christmas/,"[Link](https://forums.boxofficetheory.com/topic/31569-the-box-office-buzz-tracking-and-pre-sale-thread/page/493/#comments)

**The Color Purple MONDAY (Christmas Day) comps and projections**

- abracadabra1998 ($18.58M Thursday comps, Matinee tickets are ~54% of total tickets.  34% lower ATP for The Color Purple compared to Aquaman. Capacity starting to become a big issue. Depending on where in town, a theater is either super packed or almost empty, so 25% capacity is hiding the fact that some theaters are way more impacted than others (one theater is at almost 85% capacity!). I don't see it being able to keep up the pace it has been having due to this)

- charlie jatinder ($10.88M, I don't see 25M though, in fact probably even 20M. Mid teens probably but a lot will depend on walkups.)

- crazymoviekid (now bigger than ever, 2.4x bigger than #2 Wonka on Christmas)

- dallas (absolutely massive. I haven't seen this much in presales since Barbie)

- el sid ($13.2M - $21.5M)

- keysersoze123 (probably 25m OD is in play! but pace for 12/26 is about 1/4 of Christmas day sales and 12/27 is all about walkups.)

- M37 (Current max IMO is $23-$24, if it exceeds Barbenheimer level of occupancy across the entire MTC, $21-$22 range if it matches it. With schedules already done and so many new releases (which generally can't be touched unless they totally bomb), there isn't going to be much flexibility to cancel films and add additional shows; they by and large would have already been put up. Don't see any way to get to 600K seats from here. I cannot stress how insane it is to breach 50% let alone 60% capacity for one title across an entire MTC; only NWH and Barbenheimer have done it post-pandemic, not even the Thursdays for Strange MoM (46%), BPWF (37.8%) or Thor L&T (41%).  There's a good deal of dead weight at the bottom of the curve that's going to have a lot of empty seats, particularly for a film which is likely to have a much more metro-heavy skew, and late shows having very few sales.  I'm not at all shocked if TCP gets to $20M, but have a difficult time seeing much over $22M)

- Porthos ($17.10M Jurassic World Dominion Comp, Low 20s seems possible if not plausible if there is a lot of screen expansion, In Sacramento, 147 showtimes scheduled for TCP while Barbie at T-3 had 180 (eventually rose to 274 - and I see no way in hell TCP is gonna come close to that) even with 9am showtimes being posted, which are filling up quick. TCP at about 86% of Barbie's T-3 with nearly 33% of all seats sold [Barbie at T-3 was at 25% seats sold]. For Barbie, Sacramento ran into a huge screen scrunch and undershot the comps quite a bit.  Blamed the lack of Megaplexes (16 or more screens) locally then and I'm gonna blame it even more here.  I think it's possible we're gonna see sellouts and near-sellouts not seen since No Way Home locally, if with far fewer screens.  The relative demand is insane and relative supply is that constrained.  Final percentage of seats sold for NWH was 64.92% for the entire region at stop of tracking.  Barbie, by comparison was ""only"" 40.28%. It wouldn't surprise me if this reaches NWH level of insanity locally as well. If TCP had 65% seats sold locally at a theoretical stop of tracking 4:30-ish pm ala NWH, that'd be 11.2k tickets sold if there aren't any more screenings added.  That's a shit ton of tickets.  It's about 93% of Barbie's final total at stop of tracking (92.75%). They might be able to squeeze in a few more screens between now and Monday but even if it reached 20k seats locally, 65% seats sold of those 20k seats at theoretical stop of tracking would still be 1.08x Barbie. That's how constrained seats are locally for TCP!  Even a NWH level of percentage of seats sold ""only"" just pips it past Barbie even before matinee pricing is factored in. Obviously, Sacramento will be hella under-performing here.  But only because of capacity concerns. But it's also not going to be the only ""mid-major"" market to have similar capacity concerns, which is gonna drag the national average down from what a pure MTC 1/2/3 comp might show.)

- rehpyc (MTC 1-3 show counts.. FNAF's 24M first Saturday, 6.9K, 6.6K, 7.5K | The Marvels' 15M first Saturday, 8.6K, 6.4K, 9.4K. | TCP Xmas day, 4.6K, 3.0K, 2.9K. No IMAX, no 4DX, no ScreenX, and PLF screen allocation per MTC are only 30%, 25%, 10%.)

- TheFlatLannister ($22.14M, Wouldn't be shocked if this hits $25M OD at this point, matinee sales outpacing night showings.)

- vafrow (Good growth, but, not sure if it can reach heights similar to US markets.Even if it doubles the next two days and big walk ups, it's only getting it to a number similar to other Thursday previews of the last month (Wonka, Aquaman, HG). Sales are also heavily concentrated towards the three VIP showtimes. This is a tiny 34 seat auditorium, and its three showings make up 60% of sales. The other large auditoriums are mainly empty, with highest tickets sold is 5 tickets. Canada is obviously very different than the US, but this is a pull from a pretty diverse area.)

WHO did a big one-two punch of misinformation yesterday on Twitter. Details inside.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/18ps0lj/who_did_a_big_onetwo_punch_of_misinformation/,"As we are all aware by this point, you know things are actually bad when A) the trolls come out in force on social media and B) public health officials throw up some kind of a smoke screen.

Well yesterday the WHO did a big one-two punch that made my jaw drop.

First we need to revisit the emergency declaration ending in May.

**EMERGENCY DECLARATION ENDING**
--------

As you're aware, the WHO lowered the emergency status on May 5th, 2023.

This kind of emergency status grants access to budgets and other personnel readiness that can't be sustained for prolonged periods of time due to funding.  The emergency downgrade simply meant that these systems would go back to their normal function, and individual governments (i.e. YOU) would be financially responsible. This is when tests and vaccines became your out-of-pocket responsibility.

However, everyone desperate to go back to ""normal"", including news outlets and hospitals, took this to simply mean the pandemic was ""over.""

The WHO/CDC was, and have been, very clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is NOT over... but they certainly didn't object to letting people think that!

Let's look at Tedros' FULL statement.

* https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing---5-may-2023

> However, that does not mean COVID-19 is over as a global health threat.
> 
> Last week, COVID-19 claimed a life every three minutes – and that’s just the deaths we know about.
> 
> As we speak, thousands of people around the world are fighting for their lives in intensive care units.
> 
> And millions more continue to live with the debilitating effects of post-COVID-19 condition.
> 
> This virus is here to stay. It is still killing, and it’s still changing. The risk remains of new variants emerging that cause new surges in cases and deaths.
> 
> **The worst thing any country could do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that COVID-19 is nothing to worry about.**
> 

This VERY IMPORTANT part was not repeated anywhere, and gave people a false sense that the pandemic was over.  Only the headline of ""WHO ends COVID emergency!"" was parroted everywhere, with no details or context.

Reporting was culled, testing dropped, mitigation out the window, even in hospitals, despite the WHO saying ""please don't do that.""

Not even a couple months later we had the massive August surge thanks to Barbenheimer.

**WHO CELEBRATING EMERGENCY ENDING AND NEW DASHBOARD**
-------

Yesterday, 12/22/2023 the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the COVID-19 Technical Lead at the WHO posted two tweets in parallel.

The first, Tedros randomly celebrating the end of the WHO emergency in May. Why now while we're in a huge wave with the JN.1 variant? Because PR that's why. Perfect time to remind everyone ""we ended the pandemic in May even tho we really didn't"":

* https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1738354529387622484

At the same time, Maria posted about the WHO new dashboard... which only uses case data and makes it look like there is less COVID than when the pandemic began.  We KNOW nobody is testing, nobody is reporting, so of course their graph is going to make things look great.

Maria acknowledged in subsequent tweets that case data is not useful and wastewater/hospitalizations/etc. will be added ""next year"" -- great timing!

* https://twitter.com/mvankerkhove/status/1738213494955163753

Taken together, right before Christmas time, this was a wonderful one-two punch to aid minimizers in their righteous fight to infect everyone and make people who are taking precautions feel bad.

""Well the WHO dashboard looks great, no COVID there. Oh and WHO director just reminded us the pandemic actually ended in May! Never mind that I've had COVID 3 times since then, that didn't actually happen.""

**One only need to look at the massive disparity in the wastewater data vs cases to see what is actually happening in the real world.**

* https://twitter.com/CovidCaution/status/1738849955811573833

COVID-19 public health officials continue to wield a PR campaign gone psy-op.

This was clearly a holiday push to keep people traveling, keep people spending in the face if a massive wave with a new variant. Makes me irate.

Stay safe y'all.",87,0.98,2023-12-24 9:37:48,12
Experiences I had working,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieTheaterEmployees/comments/18n9wb5/experiences_i_had_working/,"Marked as story but its just me rambling lol. I worked at a cinemark theater and it was alright, but damn I realized how truly nasty people are and I now am more careful with cleaning up after myself when I see movies. Had the unfortunate experience of getting garbage juice all over me when trying to get a heavy bag out and it spilling liquid out on me, but hey they gave me another shirt for free (that I’ll never wear again lol). Barbenheimer was hell, the Oppenheimer theaters weren’t that bad at all but holy shit were the Barbie theaters bad. At least I quit before the FNAF movie came out lmao. Coworker drama was there too, one dude who had been working there for a while was a huge snitch (because he desperately wanted to be a manager) telling whatever manager that we had headphones in when we were alone in theaters cleaning, stuff like that.",4,0.83,2023-12-21 0:37:07,1
Shoutout to the Big Pic for being on an absolute heater all year,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigPicture/comments/18m7wtu/shoutout_to_the_big_pic_for_being_on_an_absolute/,"As we near the end of 2023, I just wanted to make an appreciation post for SF, Dobbins, CR, and Bobby for making some of my absolute favorite content this year. In no particular order, 2023 on the Big Pic gave us:

-The skinamarink voice

-two movie auctions for one of the more anticipated years in recent memory

-Garbage cash, fish, lads, and of course Sky Trash, which leads to…

-the DKR watch along (play this at CR’s HOF inductance ceremony).

-movie drafts galore, including 90s summer blockbuster (“the velociraptor has a brother”), De Niro draft (unhinged from minute 0), 2001 (discussion of what constitutes third base), 2006 (“I’m Yevgeny Prigozhin!”), Denzel with Bill and Van, Fincher, and 2020, where they do a drive by shooting of every cyclist in LA

-an ongoing discussion of who is cool, and whether or not only men over the age of 80 are cool to Amanda

-Sean pouring his heart out in a Letterboxd review of ninja turtles 

-Scorsese HOF

-Barbenheimer pods, including the one that was on Dua Lipa’s instagram

-And perhaps the highlight of the year for me, the movie star liquor taste test

I’m sure I missed some stuff, but what a year for the pod!",327,0.98,2023-12-19 17:52:37,53

Star power isn’t dead. An actor can be a box office draw while still not guaranteeing profit by themselves.,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18lg9qw/star_power_isnt_dead_an_actor_can_be_a_box_office/,"A lot of people on this sub say that star power is no longer a thing, and that no actor is a box office draw anymore, but I’d say star power is definitely still a significant factor for box office, it’s just that other factors can affect it as well. 

Some recent examples:

-Black Adam flopped, but it still did almost $400 million despite being about a character who is C-list at best, the damaged DC brand, and weak reviews. This is because of the Rock’s star power, and if it was the same movie but without him in the lead role, it would probably have a similar box office to Blue Beetle and Shazam 2. His pay added $20 million to the budget, but likely tripled the movies box office as well.

-Fast X did over $700 million, and it would have been a success if the budget wasn’t so inflated from COVID. The stars are likely the biggest draw for these movies.

-MI7 flopped because of Barbenheimer, but it still did $560 million. It would have done even worse if Tom Cruise left the franchise. If it didn’t have him and just focused on the rest of the cast, it would do less than half of what it actually did. Top Gun: Maverick also wouldn’t have been nearly as big as it was without him.

-Barbie and Oppenheimer would have been successful anyways due to the phoenomenon and good WOM, but all the stars they had likely gave them boosts as well.

When do good reviews actually motivate you to going to the cinema?,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18hhbeo/when_do_good_reviews_actually_motivate_you_to/,"Ever since Barbenheimer, I've been going more and more to the cinemas this year, often on my own. I'm so glad I've been able to see films Killers of the Flower Moon, When Evil Lurks, and Past Lives on the big screen. And had my schedule not been busy or had tickets not been sold out, I would've also seen Talk to Me, Concrete Utopia, and Poor Things while they had their runs.

Part of this is I typically go with what films have positive buzz behind them as opposed to what marketing shows for films. I do my best not to know much about the plot of films and typically avoid trailers altogether. I don't view them as previews for a movie but more as what studios think is the most marketable, and oftentimes what's the most marketable isn't what's the most interesting (just go see any Pixar trailer). But I understand this mindset of not wanting to know much about a film, TV show, or even a book before starting it isn't shared by others. That, and I also know that I'm used to more indie and arthouse filmmaking which can be alienating to some. It's not uncommon to see films with acclaim have rotten audience reactions or low Cinemascores, just see a majority of the acclaimed horror movies since the birth of film.

While I'm grateful to have streaming and be able to see even more films that I missed or never came here, there are other movies I would've liked to actually see on the big screen. For y'all, when does hearing a film have good reviews or critical acclaim, actually make you go to the cinema to see it and how can films better use reviews for marketing?",52,0.91,2023-12-13 13:55:43,80
Fixing Paramount's 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18jw5r3/fixing_paramounts_2023/,"Paramount had, I think the most frustrating 2023 of all. Yes, Disney had what felt like a never-ending conveyer belt of mediocre films that almost all tanked at an unprecedented level, and Warner Bros. had their biggest franchise in the DCEU, continuely cough out it's lasts, toxic, blood soaked breathes, but Paramount had a year that was just weird. You see with every other studio this year almost every major studio flop was , I feel, mortally wounded, most of these films weather it was The Flash or Indy 5, or The Marvels, were fairly weak movies, movies that even under the best circumstances wouldn't have been big hits cause critics and audiences just didn't like these movies that much.

However with Paramount, that wasn't exactly the case. Their three biggest movies of the year, Dungeons and Dragons, Transformers: Rise of The Beasts, and Mission Impossible 7 all had decent audience scores, with all getting above an 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and at least an A- cinema score. All the other major film this year with scores like that, like Guardians 3, Across the Spider-Verse, and Barbie, well I think we all know how they did

So why did these films with good scores underperform, well, honestly there are a lot of reasons, 2023 has been nothing if not complicated, but I'm going to posit, that really, really bad release dates were part of the problem. Paramount somehow managed to put all of their big releases in harm's way of literally the biggest films of the year. DnD opened a week before Mario made $146 Million, Transformers opened just a week after Spider-Verse made $120 Million, and most infamously, Mission Impossible opened one week before barbie and Oppenheimer opened to $162 and $82 million respectively and led to the fourth biggest weekend in Hollywood history. Again, it's hard to boil the underperformance of these films down to just their release date, but these release dates with 20/20 hindsight were particularly bad. So long story short I'm giving these movies new release dates.

So now I'm going to give these dates that I think would've been better with the benefit of hindsight and knowing how all of the movies we're perceived and how they do. So this is a super hypothetical exercise .

A. Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves - Original Date : March 31st, 2023 -> New Date: December 23-25 2022

Okay so I'm already breaking the title a bit, cause this would technically be fixing their 2022-2023 but still. There is no flop that broke my heart this year other than Dungeons and Dragons, this film was great and fun and incredibly well made, it really sucks that their likely won't be a sequel because of the box office. So what release date do I think would benefit the film the most. Well I think that Christmas would benefit this the most. Couple of things, first DnD was a movie that absolutely needed time to breathe, it opened okay in March, but had it's legs cut off by Mario, Christmas and early January would have been a perfect time to let the movie leg out. The film fits in with the mold of other adventure movies that came out in previous Decembers like the Jumanji sequels, the Night of the Museum movies, Bumblebee, etc. Another point, last December was a bit barran, there were really only two major blockbusters that month Avatar: The Way of Water and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Looking back at previous Decembers there tends to be one major blockbuster (The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, No Way Home, Rogue One, Aquaman) and then there is a bunch a major animated/kids films like Alvin and The Chipmunks 4, Sing, The Greatest Showman, Into the Spider-Verse). Looking at it like this there was room for one more big adventure like, and I think Dungeons and Dragons would have fit that perfectly. Also note that in this hypothetical the movie is done and all the vfx would be finished, which I know isn't super likely cause I'm moving the film up 4 months. I'm pointing that cause  this is me finding perfect release dates for these films within reason, not necessarily schgrinning Paramount for not picking them cause in reality the movie wasn't completely done at this point.

Alternatives

I had a lot of ideas for Dungeons and Dragons so here's a couple of other options

March 10, 2023 - Switch back with Scream 6

This is was the original plan, but paramount switched the films, looking back at it, yeah this would have been better for DnD and I don't think Scream looses much opening before Mario, very different audiences, but probably would not have saved the movie

April 21st 2023

Gives it two weeks of space from Mario and before Guardians 3, again better, but not life saving better

December 22nd 2023

I'm putting another movie here, but if it weren't for that this would've been the spot.

&#x200B;

B. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts - original date: June 9th, 2023 -> September 1st, 2023

Paramount needs to learn a lesson, as sad as it is to say, they aren't audiences top priorities any more, or at the very least this didn't any movies that were top priority. Nothing exemplifies that more than the Transformers franchise, which has historically always opened in the prime of the summer, so I imagine, either it would have been embarrassing or simply because analytics say that this franchise does well at this time of year so why change the formula, however Paramount needed to look at bigger picture here. The Last Knight completely buried the franchise for a lot of audiences, and while Bumblebee did a lot to recover the franchise's reputation, the main series still needs a bit of rehabilitating. Throwing this soft-reboot prequel thing in the middle of Summer was just a bad move. Granted it did wind up becoming the second biggest movie of that month, but still it clearly would have made more if it had a better release date. I picked labor day because it was obviously less crowded but also because it would still count for a summer film and the holiday might have given it a tiny boost. The Equalizer 3 is in this spot, but that could either move or these movie can just co-exist, not a terrible amount of overlap. Basically I don't think that Transformers works anymore in a summer filled with blockbusters, but if it's the only game in town ...

I don't have alternates for this, but basically anytime in September would've been fine too.

C. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part One - Original Date: July 12, 2023 -> New Date: December 22nd, 2023

Well Duh. Even counting the fact that no one, and I mean no one saw the pop culture fire storm that Barbenheimer was gonna be, and I'm serious, no one saw that coming. The fact remains that Paramount, Chris McQuarrie and Tom Cruise all knew that the second Oppenheimer hit theatres they were gonna lose IMAX for 6 weeks. I guess they figured the movie would do better and they could negotiate for better terms, but why go through that when Christmas is right there ? The fourth film, Ghost Protocol, opened there, and did great, and this December seemed pretty week for a long time, so I'm honestly not sure why they didn't do this instead. I get it, Top Gun Maverick was huge and Fallout did great, and Aquaman 2 is the sequel to a billion dollar, so if anyone wanted to move it to December there might have been some trepidation on there part. However as I said before, there is plenty of room for multiple films to do well in December so either way it still could've done well. All in all this just seems the most logical given all we know now, and, honestly some of what they knew then. So, yeah this makes the most logical.

Well that was long, so what do you think, am I right, am I wrong, I'm kind of tired, cheers.",24,0.87,2023-12-16 17:33:14,11

Have an excess of generic franchise movies made solid or mediocre movies into something more highly regarded?,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18ckk7z/have_an_excess_of_generic_franchise_movies_made/,"I think that in a period dominated with generic superhero or franchise movies, there has been an excess of overreaction and praise towards simply ""solid"" or above average movies, sometimes even some that have an original concept in these changing times. Would a polarizing or underwhelming film such as The Creator or Beau is Afraid be showered with sympathy and perhaps praise only because it provides a breath of fresh air from the current landscape of popular movies and to get people in theaters excited for something new for the first time in ages? Would something like Top Gun Maverick being simply a solid breath of fresh air we hadn't felt in years only boosted by the pandemic caused people to overrate it a little, when if it was released in the 80s, 90s, and even early 2010s it would've achieve the status of a respectable but not insanely beloved blockbuster such as Commando, In the Line of Fire, The Equalizer, where it's liked but no one simps for it as a Best Picture frontrunner or anything? There are multiple films that could be interchangeable with this argument, plus as demonstrated with the Barbenheimer phenomenon, there has been demonstrated quality out there that doesn't apply to this claim.

Hi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18dsr1v,,3,1,2023-12-08 18:08:33,0
Prediction: IF will be a major flop for Paramount,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18aj4vn/prediction_if_will_be_a_major_flop_for_paramount/,"On May 17, 2024, Paramount's live-action/animated hybrid comedy ""IF"" will release in theaters, moved up from May 24, 2024. Paramount might of thought that might help the movie, but it won't really. I am predicting that ""IF"" will flop big time, and here are the reasons why

**Competition a week later with 3 movies coming out on May 24**

Originally, IF was slated to release during the memorial day weekend on May 24, 2024, right up against Furiosa. Unfortunately for Paramount, every studio except Universal decided to also put their movies on May 24, with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Garfield Movie joining the crowd. Paramount realised this, and moved IF back to May 17. Unfortunately, I think this will not help.

We all know how MI7 opened a week ahead of Barbenheimer, and then ended up losing IMAX screens to Oppenheimer, and it's success was damaged as people went to see Barbie/Oppenheimer thanks to the marketing. Most people cant afford to see movies every week, so they decided to skip MI7 so they could see Barbenheimer. I feel like all 3 seem much bigger than IF, and have been talked more about online, so people will likely skip IF to see the others.

**IF is an original movie not based on anything, and we know how original franchises have been doing lately.**

One thing about IF compared to the other three movies is that it is not based on a IP. Furiosa, Garfield and Apes are based off of already known and loved IPs. IF however is a completely new story with new characters, so audiences may not want to see something completely new when they have 3 films of IPs they know and love coming out the next week.

It is a fact that movies based on established IPs do better than original ones. Out of the top 10 american films this year, all were based on IPs except Oppenheimer and Elemental. Oppenheimer had Barbenheimer to help it as well as the fact it had Christopher Nolan directing and it was a biopic. Elemental was the highest grossing completely original film not based on anything, but it was still a flop and did not do as good as Disney thought it would do, even if it was only a minor flop. After that, there are no original films until Sound of Freedom, which got $257mil, and then KOTFM, which bombed at $154mil.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I think that IF will be a major flop for Paramount. Based on the fact it has big competition from basically every other studio, and that it is a completely new story not based on anything people know, I think it will underperform bigtime for Paramount and lose money.

"37 m4f Asheville, NC - Dating apps make me sad and I'm a little shy for the cold pickup so I'm trying Reddit :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/18bracy/37_m4f_asheville_nc_dating_apps_make_me_sad_and/,"I'm attempting to start a business in digital identity although previously I worked as a data scientist. Its a lot of work. Like the title says dating apps kinda get me down and I've never been great at picking up cold so I'm aiming for reddit. IRL meetings/dates/hangouts/parallel play would be best but also down for pen pals.  
Aside from work (which is a lot of my time these days trying to bootstrap this thing off the ground) I, practice a martial art, I workout most days (maybe one day aim for an Ironman triathlon), and read for most of my spare time. I like to read one fiction book and one non-fiction book in sequence and have two lists that I pick off of in a semi-random order unless I get really into an author and want to read everything they wrote.  
I cook most of my own meals although I enjoy eating out, nothing ultra-fancy or pretentious, but the good value restaurants where they really care about the food. I'm not the best cook but what I make is edible and usually tasty enough for me. I try to eat healthy-ish 90% of the time but have cheat days on Friday where I get something like pizza or fried chicken and am not ultra strict the rest of the week. I know I'm getting older because oatmeal is my typical breakfast, maybe you're the same :)  
I listen to a lot of podcasts these days (programming/CS, science, various chess streamers, comedians, history mostly) and haven't really gotten into my netflix/max/Amazon video because of it, but once upon a time did enjoy watching good movies, good tv, anime, sci-fi, fantasy the usual nerd stuff. I'm looking forward to Dune and I want to see Napoleon in theaters before it goes away. Last two movies I saw in theaters was Barbenheimer and I loved them both.  
I enjoy meme culture and have been Internetting since I was but a boy.  
I've been in love three times so far in life, with two long term relationships. I really feel like attraction is almost random for me. I've felt it for a variety of people that maybe I shouldn't have rationally and haven't felt it for a variety of people that everyone else was crazy about. Its a mixture of personality, looks, and maybe just some underlying biochemical thing. If we hang out and we're not feeling it, no hard feelings if you move on and I hope you won't have any if I do the same. When I was young I might try to push it, but in old age I don't try to force it if the attraction isn't there.  
Anyways, this is just my stab at a different way of meeting new people, if you're interested please feel free to reach out. Can furnish pictures of myself, my fb, linkedin, whatever you feel like. Just looking for connection and new people.  
Cheers and good luck on your Internet search.",4,1,2023-12-06 0:37:09,1

"One year ago, mid budget prestige films were having trouble at the box office. Have they been faring better in 2023?",https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/189uq5e/one_year_ago_mid_budget_prestige_films_were/,"Last year we saw many articles that were worried about whether the audience for prestige films that usually get nominated for Oscars and other awards have seemed to abandon theatres. It is the reason why the box office for movies like The Fabelmans, Tar, Women Talking, Triangle of Sadness was so low despite all of them being nominated for Best Picture. We also infamously saw Babylon only 63 million on an 80 million budget which made it a bomb. 

My question is have these prestige films started performing better this year? The obvious subject everyone will focus on first is Oppenheimer and its massive commerical success however that had the world's most popular (or 2nd after Cameron) director behind it and was combined with a social phenomenon of Barbenheimer. Barbie also felt less like a presitge film and more like a blockbuster despite having Oscar nominated creatives behind it.

We also have Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon which seem to be performing better than a lot of films from last year in the adult genre. Yet the massive budgets of both these films mean that the traditional pathway to breakeven (2.5x) seems to be very far away from them.

There is also the question of PVOD which has now become an essential part of studios financial strategy. Have these movies performed well on VOD  enough last year to become break even ?",16,0.75,2023-12-03 14:34:34,29

"Using only the OBJECTIVE metrics, can someone give me a good analysis of why mission imposible 7 failed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/189w1dj/using_only_the_objective_metrics_can_someone_give/,"I know why it bombed: they arrived in Italy, where the movie was supposed to be shot, on february 24 for the first day of shooting. The country was put on lockdown the VERY next day. They had to create from scratch the entire covid protocol for movies: testing every day (at a time where there was no cheap  tests available), wearing masks (again: no cheap masks available at that time) , safety distance, closing down the entire production every time someone got symptoms (the movie was stopped seven times in a row), entire scenes had to be rewritten on the fly (the airport scene, the best in the movie, by the way, only exists because airports were basically the last empty places available everywhere in march 2020, and the desert scene exist only because it was so close to the airport and didn't necessitate covid protocols- and because mcquarrie loved the colors).

Add that  ving rhames was a person at risk, and always six feet from everywhere, and you can see how the budget ballooned and there was no way it would make its money back. No way.

But even ith its normal 200 million budget, it would have been just a modest success, a break-even, or maybe a moderate bomb, and not an ouright flop. and my question, using only objective metrics: why?

We use a lot of objective metrics in this sub, and usually the give a good idea of what an opening week-end or legs would be, but here, none of them worked:

\- It had a 99 percent fresh on rotten tomatoes for the entire first week of exploitation (which is when in mattered the most) and then stablised at 95 percent, highest in the series.

\- Universal acclaim on metacritic.

\- A cinemascore

\- 90 posttrak, with over 80 percent would recommend or strongly recommend

\- 95 percent on cinetrak, a score i have never seen for any other movie

\- the highest IMDB score from the users of the franchise.

\-- on the foreign ""metacritics"" i can consult, it's the same thing: it has over 4/5 on allocine, which agregates french reviews a score i have never seen for an action movie, and usually reserved for big prestige projects. It has 9.4 on muoyan, which, as i understand, is a pretty big score.

\- its opening is hard to calculate, since it opened on a tuesday, but if you think in terms of opening rather than opening week-end, it had the biggest opening worldwide of the franchise.

\- It will end as the seventh (or sixth? i'm not sure) movie of the year globally, which is around where every movie since the fourth have ended by the end of the year: but with more than 100 million dollars short of fallout, so why?

\- and finally: fallout was considered the best MI, before that, it was rogue nation, and before that ghost protocol, among GA: so why doesn't the compound effect of the reception, and the trust in the brand, worked for this movie, while it worked for thor: the dark world, for example?

&#x200B;

I know of barbenheimer,but that doesn't explain everthing: it has better objective reception than both, when all combined.

 i know of the imax situation, but it doesn't explain the drop in attendance in coutries that counts tickets and not dollars.

I know it's the seventh movie: but exept for five and six, every movie is an independent mission, like james bond it has a new villain, a new henchman, a new mcguffin, a new threat, a new plan, no returning characters except the core team, and new team members: it's just like Bond, they're episodic, so i don't understand why it would affect the movie?

I kno it's called part one (and that's a a huuuuge mistake): but the movie has one clear missio (retrieve the key), immediately says that what the key unlocks is irrelevant (the characters learn it two minutes before the end of the movie) and the movie ends with the mission completed: it's literally a complete movie, with one single mission, and just a nod to the next mission.

 by its own strenghth, by its own metrics, shouldn't it have done more? does that mean that all these tools are worthless if all, in conjuction, indicates a success by the usual rules of the sub, while the movie bombed? Is there another case of a movie that ell received, that ell acclaimed, by audience and critics alike, coming out of the goodwill of at least three similarily acclaimed movie, and who outright bombed?",1,0.52,2023-12-03 15:39:24,37

A Look Into Warner Bros. Pictures 2024: The New Era,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/184ty4f/a_look_into_warner_bros_pictures_2024_the_new_era/,"In this post, I will look into Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio that tried to avoid the centennial curse by not having a 100th anniversary logo on their films but still suffered from the centennial curse like Universal, Paramount, and Disney. Warner Bros is known for the Harry Potter films, American Sniper, and the DC films. Recently, Warner Bros is known for Evil Dead Rise, Meg 2: The Trench, The Nun II, and their highest grossing film of all time, Barbie. 

# Warner Bros. Pictures In The Past Three Years

Warner Bros placed third in 2020, making $226M domestically with a market share of 11.38%. Birds of Prey and Tenet were their biggest films that year, though they were box office failures due to Sonic the Hedgehog and COVID, respectively. At least it got them above Disney and Paramount that year. In 2021, Warner Bros gave all of their films the simultaneous HBO Max/theatrical hybrid. The result? Fourth place, making $653M domestically with a market share of 14%. It was the films co-produced with Legendary that were Warner Bros’ biggest films, which were Godzilla vs. Kong and Dune. Unfortunately, this incident would lead to Legendary partnering with Sony around 2023. 2022 was slightly better, as they made $938M domestically with a market share of 13%. However, they were still in fourth. While Warner Bros did better than Sony that year, they still lost to the likes of Universal, Disney, and even Paramount (which had a phenomenal year). Let’s see how Warner Bros did on their 100th anniversary.

# 2023

**House Party** \- This was originally slated for an HBO Max release before moving to a theatrical release. However, House Party only made $9M, a lot less than the $26M made by the original back in 1990. Unless the budget was $4M or less, I doubt that Warner Bros made money on this film.

**Magic Mike’s Last Dance** \- Magic Mike’s Last Dance was another film that was originally an HBO Max release before moving to a theatrical release. The result was $57M on a budget of $45M, being an underperformance for Warner Bros. This was too little, too late as Magic Mike XXL came out back in 2015, eight years ago. If Warner Bros wanted the film to do as well as the first two, this is a film that should've been released in the late 2010s, not 2023. 

**Shazam! Fury of the Gods** \- When you’re squished in between Scream VI and John Wick: Chapter 4, you’re not going to have much room for growth. That was the case with Shazam! Fury of the Gods. The film made $134M on a budget of $125M, being a box office bomb for Warner Bros. James Gunn said that he was open to some characters from the DCEU showing up in the new DCU, but after this film, this iteration of Shazam will be stuck in the DCEU. Three failures in a row. Thank goodness Warner Bros’ next film is a horror film. Horror films almost always make money.

**Evil Dead Rise** \- Evil Dead Rise is the third film to originally have an HBO Max release before moving to a theatrical release. While House Party and Magic Mike’s Last Dance were commercial failures, this was a hit for Warner Bros. Evil Dead Rise made $147M on a budget of $19M. It was a film people could watch in April that wasn’t The Super Mario Bros. Movie. This was Warner Bros’ first success in their 100th anniversary. Unfortunately for Warner Bros, their next film is The Flash.

**The Flash** \- If there was any superhero film that should’ve marketed themselves as “one of the best superhero films since The Dark Knight”, it should’ve been Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, not The Flash. The Flash made $271M on a budget of $220M, being one of the biggest box office bombs from Warner Bros. Ezra Miller being in the film definitely didn’t help either. Warner Bros expected The Flash to be one of their biggest films this year, and it blew up in their face. Fortunately for Warner Bros, their next film would save them.

**Barbie** \- There’s a scene in The Flash where Barry Allen references Aqua’s Barbie Girl. The Flash didn’t set up future DC movies, but it did set up Warner Bros’ next film. I thought this film would only make $300M worldwide, and I’m sure most people thought similar numbers. But no one would expect Barbie of all films to be the biggest film of 2023, not even Warner Bros. Barbie made $1.442B on a budget of $145M. Barbenheimer helped this film and without it, I think it would’ve only reached $1.3B, which is still amazing. People that were hyped about Barbie decided to also check out Oppenheimer, while people that were hyped about Oppenheimer decided to also check out Barbie. Barbie surpassed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to be the highest grossing film from Warner Bros. 

**Meg 2: The Trench** \- Meg 2: The Trench was never going to follow in the footsteps that Barbie set, but it still did pretty good, at least overseas. The film made $395M on a budget of $139M. While it didn’t make as much as the first film, it was another hit for Warner Bros, though obviously not as much of a moneymaker as Barbie.

**Blue Beetle** \- Determined to follow in the footsteps of the other DC films, Blue Beetle bombs in theaters. The film only made $129M on a budget of $104M, making it the lowest grossing DCEU film. At least Warner Bros has The Nun II right around the corner.

**The Nun II** \- If I had a nickel for every time a horror film released to commercial success right after a DC film blew up in Warner Bros’ face in 2023, I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice. The Nun II made $268M on a budget of $38M, being another hit for Warner Bros despite not making as much as the original.

**Warner Bros Films That Haven’t Been Released Yet**

There are three films from Warner Bros that haven’t been released yet that are still slated to come out in 2023: Wonka, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and The Color Purple. Let’s see how well these films will do.

**Wonka** \- It’s a musical fantasy film directed by Paul King and is supposed to be an origin story for Willy Wonka. Box Office Pro has the film tracking at anywhere from $125M-$210M domestically, which was unexpected for me. Despite there being previous films featuring Willy Wonka, this just seems like a wildcard that will depend on how the film’s quality is. If bad like some of the reported test screenings, I’d say $130M domestically and $270M worldwide. If it turns out to be good like Paul King’s Paddington films, I’d say $200M domestically and $500M worldwide. 

**Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom** \- It’s a superhero film directed by James Wan and is the final film in the DCEU. Unfortunately for the DCEU, I think it will end with a whimper, not a bang. Box Office Pro has it tracking anywhere from $105M-$168M, which is a lot less than the original Aquaman back in 2018. I’d say the film makes $160M domestically and $400M worldwide. Christmas will help this film, but it will lose money for Warner Bros. I really hope Superman: Legacy knocks it out of the park in July 2025.

**The Color Purple** \- It’s a musical coming of age period drama film directed by Blitz Bazawule and is based on the musical of the same name, which also had a film back in 1985 which was based on the book. Warner Bros is insane for releasing two musicals, and Wonka will most likely do better. I’d say the film makes $70M domestically and $110M worldwide. If the budget is $50M or less, this could be a moderate success for Warner Bros.

# How Was Warner Bros’ 100th Anniversary?

Warner Bros managed to get to third place, making over $1.1B domestically (should be at $1.3B by the end of the year) with a market share of 14%. The centennial curse got to Warner Bros, but they’re at least not suffering as much as Disney is. Warner Bros really wants DC to be their cash cow, but the offerings this year are not helping the brand. Horror films like Evil Dead Rise, Meg 2: The Trench, and The Nun II were hits for Warner Bros, though horror is a safe genre to make money out of. Barbie is also their highest grossing film, so this year wasn’t too bad for Warner Bros. Barbie carried the box office with the horror films as support. House Party and Magic Mike’s Last Dance didn’t help WB at all, and the state of DC is concerning. With the possibility of superhero fatigue, WB should hope that they can rise above that with the DCU, hopefully with more quality in it compared to the DCEU. Let’s see how 2024 is for Warner Bros.

# 2024


# Dune: Part Two 

It’s an epic science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and is the sequel to Dune. Warner Bros is kickstarting 2024 with a bang here. The first film was well received, and a more action packed sequel should be able to make a lot more. I’m going to be fucking insane here and say Dune: Part Two makes $280M domestic and $750M worldwide. As the first blockbuster of the year that isn’t Madame Web, this film will bring people to the theaters.

# Mickey 17 

It’s a science fiction film directed by Bong Joon-ho and is based on the novel called Mickey7. Coming off the success of Parasite, I think there’s going to be some interest in Mickey 17. I’d say Mickey 17 makes $80M domestically and $200M worldwide. A budget of $90M or less should allow the film to make a modest profit. One downside is that Warner Bros’ other sci-fi film in March, Dune: Part Two, will overshadow the film by a lot. The second downside is that Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire releases the same day, which could also hurt Mickey 17.

# The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie

It’s a sci-fi adventure comedy film directed by Pete Browngardt and is part of the Looney Tunes franchise. That’s three sci-fi films in a row from Warner Bros. Goodness. The plot is about Daffy Duck and Porky Pig as they try to stop an alien invasion. The expected release date is in the second quarter of 2024. If Warner Bros is smart, they’d release the film in April as there’s nothing really for families around that time, except for maybe Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. I’d say The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie could make $80M domestically and $180M worldwide. I just hope Warner Bros gives the film a good release date.

# Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire 

It’s a monster film directed by Adam Wingard and is the sequel to Godzilla vs. Kong. Godzilla vs. Kong was able to make almost half a billion despite releasing during the COVID pandemic. This should be able to make a lot more, especially if the film is like Godzilla vs. Kong (and less like King of the Monsters). I’d say Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire makes $210M domestically and $600M worldwide, being the highest grossing film in the Monsterverse franchise. 

# Furiosa 

It’s a post-apocalyptic action adventure film directed by George Miller and is a spinoff of the Mad Max franchise. It’s been nine years since the last Mad Max film, and even Fury Road didn’t really make money. I just don’t see Furiosa doing as well as Fury Road. I’d say Furiosa makes $110M domestically and $250M worldwide.

# The Watchers 

It’s a supernatural horror film directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan and is based on the novel of the same name. The premise seems interesting, and I’m wondering if Ishana will follow in the footsteps of her father and have some twist ending. I can see it doing better than Knock at the Cabin, but it is facing competition from Lionsgate’s Ballerina the same day. I’d say The Watchers makes $40M domestically and $80M worldwide.

# Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 

It’s an epic western film directed by Kevin Costner. We haven’t seen an epic western like this, but these kinds of films aren’t driving people to the theaters anymore. Either no one cares or studios just don’t really try. I don’t know. I’d say Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 will make $80M domestically and $110M worldwide. Maybe this can surprise me and make $400M or something. We’ll see.

# Trap 

It’s a film from M. Night Shyamalan. After he ditched Universal due to the underperformance of Knock at the Cabin, he came back to Warner Bros with Trap. I don’t know anything about this film. If he gives the film a better premise than Knock at the Cabin, I’d say Trap can make $30M domestically and $70M worldwide. The daughter might be able to surpass the father in this case.

# Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 

It’s an epic western film directed by Kevin Costner and is the sequel to Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1. If you don’t see Chapter 1 in theaters, I doubt you’d see Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2. There’s not enough time to build an audience for the first chapter post theatrical life since Chapter 2 releases less than two months after. I’d say the film makes $70M domestically and $90M worldwide. Kevin Costner wanted to make four films in this saga. I think a third film is still happening since production was paused due to the writer and actor’s strike. The fourth one will most likely not happen, unless the first two chapters somehow do gangbusters at the box office like how westerns used to do back in the 1950s and 1960s.

# Beetlejuice 2 

It’s a fantasy comedy film directed by Tim Burton and is the sequel to Beetlejuice. I’m sure Jenna Ortega will bring people to watch Beetlejuice 2 and maybe the Keaton walkups will help, but I doubt it will make a lot more than the original. I’d say the film makes $90M domestically and $120M worldwide. If the budget isn’t more than $50M, this film should be able to make a modest profit for Warner Bros.

# Joker: Folie a Deux 

It’s a musical thriller film directed by Todd Phillips and is the sequel to Joker. It is also one of the few DC properties to actually make money in this day and age. There’s concern that the musical aspect of the film will turn people off, but I actually think more people could show up, especially if the musical parts are executed very well. Lady Gaga is now a part of the cast and she’s shown to be a great actor with A Star is Born and House of Gucci. I’d say the film makes $350M domestically and $1.1B worldwide, being the biggest Warner Bros film of 2024. I wonder if they’ll bring in Batman at some point. 

# Alto Knights 

It’s a gangster film directed by Barry Levinson. Not much is known about the film except the plot, in which Frank Costello decides to retire from the mafia after Vito Genovese orders a hit on him. Not a lot of gangster films are being made nowadays, so it’s hard to judge, similar to the Horizon films. Maybe a good comparison is Killers of the Flower Moon, and that did $150M. Alto Knights’ premise and the use of Robert de Niro does seem like something Martin Scorsese would do. I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt, I’d say Alto Knights will make $60M domestically and $100M worldwide, which should give Warner Bros a small profit.

# The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim 

It’s a fantasy film directed by Kenji Kamiyama and is a prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Obviously, this isn’t going to make anywhere near what the live action Middle Earth films make, but it is going for a more anime look. Anime has gotten a lot more mainstream recently, so an American film studio backing a film like The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim could make this one of the biggest anime films yet. I’d say the film makes $200M domestically and $500M worldwide. If this does well, it could open the door for more American film studios to have more anime like films. 

If These Films Had To Move, Where Should They Go?

Dune: Part Two - March 15, 2024

Mickey 17 - April 5, 2024

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire - April 19, 2024

Furiosa - May 31, 2024

The Watchers - June 21, 2024

Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 - July 3, 2024

Beetlejuice 2 - August 9, 2024

Joker: Folie a Deux - September 27, 2024

Trap - October 4, 2024

Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 - November 1, 2024

Alto Knights - December 13, 2024

The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim - December 25, 2024

**Thoughts on the 2024 Slate** \- Even when major film studios have a lower output next year due to the writers and actors’ strikes affecting production, Warner Bros still has a decent amount of films. Dune: Part Two, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, Joker: Folie a Deux, and The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim should be guaranteed hits. Everything else should do okay, with the exception of both Horizon films and Furiosa. I just don’t see them breaking out, though I’m not saying it’s impossible.

**The Future** \- Warner Bros got a hold of Fixed, a Sony Pictures Animation film. Films that are done but with no release date are: Mortal Kombat 2 and Salem’s Lot. Clint Eastwood is still making films with the upcoming Juror #2. An animated Cat in the Hat film is in development. Minecraft is getting a live action adaptation for some reason. The Batman is getting a sequel. DC is getting a reboot with Superman: Legacy kicking it off (hopefully with a stronger start this time).",148,0.93,2023-11-27 3:58:46,81

It still amazes me just how many movies missed the $200M mark domestically this year,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/17yjvub/it_still_amazes_me_just_how_many_movies_missed/,"Flash back to one year ago, I was pretty positive that 2023's domestic box office would have a lot of big grossers.  This also meant more movies hitting $200M domestic.  November has been a blood bath so far and with Aquaman 2 as the last franchise movie this year that even has a chance at making well over $100M domestic, it made me realize this may or may not be the eighth movie this year to hit $200M domestic.

In 2022 - Top Gun 2, Avatar 2, all 3 MCU movies, Minions 2, The Batman, Jurassic World 3

In 2023 - GOTG 3, Ant-Man 3, Barbie, Oppenheimer, Mario, Spider-Man, Little Mermaid.  There were way more franchise movies released this year than 2022 and yet, less $200M grossers. 

2 of the 2023 domestic grossers that hit $200M are often called underperformers but compared to the rest of the year's massive shortcomings, they look much more successful.  Barbenheimer was a big event but leading up to that and the months since have been either flop heavy or just slow.  The big lesson this year beyond budget control is that so many franchises are not what they once were.  Mission: Impossible, Marvels, Indiana Jones 5, Flash are the big four movies that I was pretty confident would hit $200M domestic.  3 of them were historic disasters.  

On the bright side, 20 movies have passed $100M domestic versus 18 in 2022.  Hunger Games, Wish, Aquaman 2, Wonka and Migration will hopefully bring that number to 25 movies over $100M (31 in 2019 but progress. ",87,0.91,2023-11-19 0:01:15,56
8 should be the end.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mission_Impossible/comments/17zlxvu/8_should_be_the_end/,"I think DR1 was great. Not in the same level with Fallout but i still think it's the second best of the series(which tells a lot). The fact that it's the SEVENTH installment of this franchise and still it's this good is just fantastic. BUT for 3 reasons i think it's time to send Ethan Hunt to his well deserved permenant vacation.

1-There is no enemy stronger than The Entity. It's basically The Devil himself. Finding a villain stronger than The Entity is impossible.

2-DR1 had this sense of finality in it. 

3-The constant whining. Now i defended DR1 to death and i hate the way some people are treating this movie as if it's the worst thing happened since the atomic bombs. I also think they are still the vocal minority. But i get some of their points. One of the points that has been made is that people will eventually get tired of a franchise after a while no matter how good those movies are. I don't think the underwhelming financial response of DR1 has anything to do with that but i've seen many people(most of them are consumed by Barbenheimer brainrot) that are keep talking about it(Homestly how did they survive the last 6 movies?) To the point that i actually worry about the impact of this bullshit on Mission 8. 

Again, i don't think DR1 failed because people were tired of it, i can guarantee that this movie would've shattered any franchise record if it wasn't for bad release date and having Part 1 in it's title and we wouldn't even need to have this convo, but that day will eventually come. The best way to prevent this is to end the series in Mission 8. Not only it will bring back the hype, people will see the movie to say goodbye to an Icon, but also the negative aura that has surrounded this franchise will be disappeared.

Almost the same thing happened for Daniel Craig in No Time To Die. After Spectre many people, including the man himslef, were nagging about how they are tired of ""the serious Bond"" but when No Time To Die was about to be released, everyone were praising the man because of what he did for that role. Tom Cruise got this good will in the last year after Top Gun: Maverick became the main cultural event of 2022 but if he wants the same thing for Ethan. Mission 8 is the right and critical time to do it. They don't even need to kill my boy Ethan. He just needs to take a long break like what Indiana Jones after The Last Crusade did(ofcourse M:I-9 shouldn't become Crystal Skull).",11,0.68,2023-11-20 10:54:48,32
Best Theater in the Upper Midwest?,https://www.reddit.com/r/imax/comments/17xwwy9/best_theater_in_the_upper_midwest/,"Hi!  
  
We just moved up to Wisconsin from Oklahoma this last May. We did Barbenheimer weekend split between the IMAX in Fitchburg, WI (Oppenheimer) and our local Marcus cinema (Barbie) and I was SUPER disapointed in the ""IMAX"" up here. I thought the ""regular"" theater showing Barbie was a better overall movie experience and that the IMAX was pretty subpar from what I was used to. The screen seemed kinda small, had grainy artifacts, and the audio was really week in the lows and didn't feel surround at all.  
  
So I'm pretty hype about Dune 2 and I'm willing to put some miles in to get the best possible experience. A trip to Grand Rapids sounds really fun, but March might not be the best time for us to go that far, but is that the best bet?

A Look Into Paramount Pictures 2024: Not A Lot To Love,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/17z2f5u/a_look_into_paramount_pictures_2024_not_a_lot_to/,"In this post, I will look into Paramount Pictures, the studio that sucks at scheduling for some reason. Paramount is known for Forrest Gump, Titanic, and Top Gun: Maverick. Recently, Paramount is known for Scream VI, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie.

# Paramount Pictures In The Past Three Years

Paramount was last place in 2020, making $181M domestically with a 9% market share. Sonic the Hedgehog pretty much carried Paramount in 2020 as Like a Boss and The Rhythm Section blew up Paramount’s face. Because of the COVID pandemic, Sonic the Hedgehog was able to become the sixth highest grossing film of 2020. While Paramount was able to make $278M domestically in 2021, they actually dropped to sixth place with a 6% market share, losing to United Artists. To be fair, United Artists did have a James Bond film in the form of No Time to Die, but this is still not a good look for a major film studio. 2021 is a recovery period, and while Paramount made money with A Quiet Place: Part II and PAW Patrol: The Movie, Snake Eyes and Clifford the Big Red Dog lost money for the studio. And then 2022 happened. Suddenly, Paramount started succeeding. After about a decade of being last place, Paramount was third place, making $1.3B domestically with a 17% market share. Scream, Jackass Forever, The Lost City, Smile, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 were successes but none were as big as the $719M that Top Gun: Maverick made. Top Gun: Maverick pretty much carried Paramount in 2022, though most of the other films still did well. Paramount was able to surpass Warner Bros and Sony, which hadn’t happened since the early 2010s. Based on how 2023 went, it seemed like 2022 was a fluke.

# 2023

**80 for Brady** \- While Paramount wasn’t able to distribute Book Club: The Next Chapter, Paramount kicks off 2023 with 80 for Brady, which is pretty much a spiritual successor to Book Club. While it didn’t perform as poorly as Book Club: The Next Chapter, 80 for Brady wasn’t able to match the numbers that Book Club did five years ago. I predicted that 80 for Brady would make $40M, and I was spot on. The budget ended up being $28M, underperforming for Paramount. It brought some elderly people to the theaters, but the football aspect made it a little too niche for the film to be able to break even.

**Scream VI** \- Scream VI is up next, and it delivered. The film made $169M on a budget of $35M, being a box office success for Paramount. Unfortunately for Paramount, they can’t say the same for their other March release.

**Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves** \- Who at Paramount thought it was a good idea to squish Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves in between John Wick: Chapter 4 and The Super Mario Bros. Movie? Because that’s a pretty dumb idea. The $150M film made only $208M, underperforming for Paramount. Had the film not been surrounded with competition, I think $300M would’ve been doable for the film, putting it around the breakeven point.

**Transformers: Rise of the Beasts** \- Who at Paramount thought it was a good idea to release Transformers: Rise of the Beasts right after Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse? I get that Bumblebee still made more than Into the Spider-Verse back in 2018, but still. It also came out a week before The Flash, and while that film was a huge bomb, it did take some people away from Rise of the Beasts. The film made $439M on a budget of $200M. Had it not release in early June and in a less competitive spot, I think $500M would’ve been doable for the film, putting it around the breakeven point. The days of Transformers films bringing in over $700M is in the past. Paramount should hope that Transformers One doesn’t blow up in their face when it releases next year.

**Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One** \- Who at Paramount thought it was a good idea to release Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One right before Barbenheimer? I get that Mission: Impossible has a longer history of making money at the box office, and it wasn’t wrong to think that Dead Reckoning could possibly get that Top Gun: Maverick charm, but Paramount was stupid to only have one week for the film to be on IMAX screens. With a better release date, I think $700M would’ve been doable, being a moderate success. However, in reality, the film only made $568M on a budget of $291M, being Paramount’s most expensive film to date and being a box office disappointment. It seems like Paramount is learning their lesson as the eighth Mission: Impossible film is releasing on Memorial Day weekend like Top Gun: Maverick did as well as having at least three weeks for IMAX.

**Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem** \- Up next was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Paramount’s chance at reviving the TMNT brand on film. Fortunately, the reviews have considered this film to be the strongest TMNT film to date. In my opinion, I think Mutant Mayhem is a better made film, but I think the 1990 film is a better TMNT film. If that makes sense. While Mutant Mayhem wasn’t able to make as much as the live action films that Paramount released in the 2010s, it still made a respectable $181M on a budget of $70M. This would make it a moderate success, but one Paramount needed after three underperformers.

**PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie** \- Nickelodeon’s back must be hurting for carrying Paramount this year. Not only were they behind Mutant Mayhem, they released PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie right after. The film made $189M on a budget of $30M, being a huge win for Paramount. Scream and PAW Patrol being stable franchises for Paramount is much needed when Transformers and Mission: Impossible have become a little unreliable.

**Pet Sematary: Bloodlines** \- I don’t get why Pet Sematary: Bloodlines didn’t get a theatrical release. The 2019 film made $113M. I think Bloodlines could’ve still made $40M domestically and $100M worldwide had it released theatrically. Such a missed opportunity for Paramount, especially when their theatrical lineup this year hadn’t been too financially stable.

**Killers of the Flower Moon** \- Martin Scorsese strikes back with genuine cinema in the form of Killers of the Flower Moon. Paramount has the theatrical rights to the film, while Apple has the streaming rights for the film. While it was considered as one of Martin Scorsese’s stronger films, the film only made $146M on a budget of $200M, being a box office bomb. I don’t think Apple and Paramount expected a film like Killers of the Flower Moon to make something like $700M anyways. This was more for the prestige and giving directors like Martin Scorsese full control.

# How Did Paramount Pictures Do This Year?

It’s unfortunate that 2022 wasn’t the start of Paramount’s comeback, rather, just a fluke. Only Killers of the Flower Moon is a box office bomb, but the budget was split between Apple and Paramount. D&D, Transformers, and especially Mission: Impossible underperforming must’ve hurt the studio. Scream and the Nickelodeon films have definitely softened the losses that Paramount faced this year from its underperformance and its poor scheduling. Whoever is in charge of scheduling the Paramount films this year should be removed from their position. Paramount is back in last place again, making $837M domestically with a 10% market share. Paramount should hope that 2024 is somewhat better for them. Let’s see how well 2024 is for Paramount.

# 2024

# Mean Girls

It’s a musical comedy film directed by Arturo Perez Jr. and Samantha Jayne and is based on the Broadway musical of the same name, which is based on the 2004 film of the same name. Originally a streaming film, Paramount decided to give the film a theatrical release. While this is a good idea, I don’t see the 2024 film making as much as the original 2004 film. The 2004 Mean Girls seems irreplaceable for many, and the marketing has failed to effectively convey the musical aspect of the film. However, nostalgia can be a powerful tool that can still bring some fans of the 2004 film into the theater. I’d say Mean Girls makes $80M domestically and $120M worldwide. As long as Paramount didn’t spend $60M+ on this film, I think it should still be a hit.

# Bob Marley: One Love

It’s a biographical drama musical film directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green and is based on the life of Bob Marley. Of the two musicals that we’re getting from Paramount this year (unless A Quiet Place: Day One somehow turns into a musical), I think Bob Marley: One Love will be the better musical in terms of the box office. Music biopics usually do better than straight up musicals in recent years, and Bob Marley is a famous musician. I’d say the film makes $100M domestically and $210M worldwide.

# IF

It’s a fantasy comedy film directed by John Krasinksi. Not much is known about the film except the plot, which is about a young girl who is able to see imaginary friends that were abandoned by the kids that created them. Kind of crazy that we’re getting two films about imaginary friends this year. One being Lionsgate’s Imaginary, which is a horror film, and Paramount’s IF, which is much more light-hearted. John Krasinski’s previous work with the two A Quiet Place films have been successful for him, so I think IF should be fine. I’d say the film makes $120M domestically and $270M worldwide.

# A Quiet Place: Day One

It’s a post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Michael Sarnoski and is a spin-off prequel to A Quiet Place. The “Day One” part of the title intrigues me. Seeing the events that lead up to the world of the first A Quiet Place could get a lot of people interested. I don’t see it making as much as the first two, but I’d say A Quiet Place: Day One will make $150M domestically and $280M worldwide.

# Transformers One

It’s part of the Transformers franchise and the first theatrical animated Transformers film from Paramount. After the commercial disappointment in Rise of the Beasts, Transformers One could be the determining factor in how the franchise will be treated from here on out. Supposedly, this is meant to be a prequel to the Transformers films. I don’t know which films it’s a prequel of, but it seems like humans won’t really be involved in this film. If the movie is good, I’d say the film makes $140M domestically and $420M worldwide.  Not as much as Rise of the Beasts, but I’m guessing the film would be a lot cheaper than the $200M that made Rise of the Beasts, which should give Transformers One a chance to be a hit. Hopefully, the budget is no more than $120M.

# Smile 2

It’s a sequel to Smile and is directed by Parker Finn. If Smile 2 were to stay in 2024, production should start by February at most. What made Smile work was the simplicity and the novelty of the premise. With the sequel, that novelty is gone. It could still get people if it takes the story in new and interesting ways, but horror sequels usually aren’t as good as the originals. I’d say the film makes $90M domestically and $200M worldwide. Unless Smile 2 can somehow provide something new, I don’t see how the second one will make more than the first.

# Gladiator 2

It’s an epic historical drama film directed by Ridley Scott and is the sequel to Gladiator. Like Smile, I don’t know if people were really clamoring a sequel to Gladiator, especially over two decades after the release of the first film. If Ridley Scott can somehow make the sequel about as engaging as the first one, maybe it can do well. I’d say the film will make $180M domestically and $400M worldwide. I don’t see this film surpassing the first, but $400M seems doable in a best case scenario. I hope Gladiator 2 can still make the November 2024 release date with the strikes affecting filming, but Ridley Scott is known for filming pretty fast, so we’ll see.

# Sonic the Hedgehog 3

It’s an action adventure comedy film directed by Jeff Fowler and is the third film in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. I really hope the film makes the December 2024 release date with the strikes affecting filming, but we’ll see. I also hope Jim Carrey comes back for the third one, but that’s still unknown for the time being. Bringing Shadow for Sonic 3 is a smart move. Shadow is one of the most popular characters in the Sonic franchise, so that should boost the numbers. Couple that with a holiday release (assuming it stays), and I could see Sonic 3 doing gangbusters Christmas of 2024. I’d say the film makes $250M domestically and $600M worldwide. That should put it within the top 25 highest grossing Paramount films domestically and worldwide. I’m guessing Paramount sees Sonic the Hedgehog 3 as their biggest film next year, and I think it has no trouble being that. I know Mufasa: The Lion King comes out the same day, but I think there’s a lot more interest in Sonic 3 than Mufasa.

If These Films Had To Move, Where Should They Go?

Bob Marley: One Love - February 2, 2024

Mean Girls - February 23, 2024

IF - June 28, 2024

A Quiet Place: Day One - August 9, 2024

Smile 2 - September 27, 2024

Transformers One - November 1, 2024

Gladiator 2 - December 13, 2024

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - December 25, 2024

**Thoughts on the 2024 Slate** \- For what it is, it’s okay. Sonic 3 is going to be Paramount’s biggest film in 2024, but it should be fine. I think it’s a mistake for The Tiger’s Apprentice to be stuck on Paramount+. Hopefully, Apartment 7A and Dear Santa can get theatrical releases in 2024 to strengthen Paramount’s lineup. Had those three films been scheduled for theatrical releases in 2024, it would’ve made the lineup go from okay to pretty good.

**The Future** \- A Quiet Place Part III is happening sometime in 2025. Paramount will actually be taking advantage of their Nickelodeon properties with an animated musical Smurfs film, The Spongebob Squarepants Movie: Search for Squarepants, and an animated Avatar: The Last Airbender film that follows Aang and friends after the events of the show. PAW Patrol 3 is happening sometime in 2026. Mission: Impossible 8 will release on May 23, 2025, with Paramount hoping to catch that Top Gun: Maverick magic that MI7 failed to catch.",53,0.95,2023-11-19 17:41:17,40

Why didn’t TMNT: Mutant Mayhem do better at the box office?,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/17uhwcu/why_didnt_tmnt_mutant_mayhem_do_better_at_the_box/,"Despite highly positive reception, and being considered the best Ninja Turtles movie, it only made $180 million against a $70 million budget, and likely only barely broke even.

What is the reason it wasn’t a bigger hit then it was? It was easily better than the Mario movie, and it had better reception than Elemental as well, and those movies made so much more. 

Was it just because of too much competition? It released alongside the Meg 2, and Barbenheimer was still going very strong. Haunted Mansion, another family movie, had also just come out. Blue Beetle also came out shortly afterwards. 

I also wonder if the reception to Michael Bay’s live-action Turtles movies damaged the brand too much.
