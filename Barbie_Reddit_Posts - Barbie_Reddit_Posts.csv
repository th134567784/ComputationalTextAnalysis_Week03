Barbie from Barbie Movie by Anastasia Komori,https://i.redd.it/2z3u34h6bgcc1.jpeg,,118,1,2024-01-14 18:46:19,1
The Barbie Movie,https://www.reddit.com/r/agender/comments/196eh9r/the_barbie_movie/,"I loved Barbie. It was the clearest movie I've ever seen when it comes to explaining gender. It hit me in a way I've seen no-one talk about so I wanted to share, even though this was months ago.

I'm AFAB so the themes on sexism were very familiar to me. But what wasn't familiar was the gender solidarity. The way all the women seemed connected. Same for the men. Loads of women who watched the movie said the girlhood was so comforting it brought them to tears. There were so many gender parallel scenes that male and female viewers said were accurate representation.

As an agender person watching the film, I had never felt more genderless. It felt like observing  clubs I wasn't a part of, and only just fully realising I wasn't a part of them. I cried over the movie because I finally understood what it meant to have a gender, and how I definitely didn't have one. It was made lonelier because I had no-one to tell.

Did anyone else have an experience like this?",119,0.99,2024-01-14 12:07:37,34

"MMW: In the inevitable Broadway musical adaptation of the Barbie movie, Taylor Louderman will play Barbie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkMyWords/comments/1967lga/mmw_in_the_inevitable_broadway_musical_adaptation/,"Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie have already said that have discussed turning Barbie into a Broadway musical, but really, it was coming before that. Hugely successful, already had a couple of songs, and the fantasy surreal nature of the film would translate well into a musical. 

So the question is who will play Barbie? I say Taylor Louderman. She's best known for her Tony nominated role as Regina in the Mean Girls musical (another very pink movie). She has the look required for the part, she's a talented actress, singer and dancer. It's a logical choice.",2,0.75,2024-01-14 4:43:16,0

I think it must have been something about becoming true woman.

"Honestly, the Barbie movie is really, really good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1907834/honestly_the_barbie_movie_is_really_really_good/,"I had resisted watching it because it's obviously an extended commercial that they want me to pay to see.  And it is that, of course.

But it's also a really, genuinely good movie.  It's a work of art.  I thought the ending was a little tacked-on.  I wouldn't have known how to end it, either.  But the journey was really enjoyable, understandable, and edifying without being preachy.  If gender equality is an idea you despise, then it will probably seem very preachy to you, because you're never not exposed to it throughout.  It's what the movie is about.  But if you're open to the idea that girls are typically raised under very different circumstances and with very different expectations and dangers than boys, this movie does a great job of bringing that reality home with gentleness, humor, empathy, and fun.  

I don't know what it's like to grow up as a girl.  I know what it's like to grow up as an effeminate boy who had crushes on other boys from about age 5.  What I went through sucked worse than any child should have to endure.  But for all that, my creativity was always encouraged.  People always wanted to hear my ideas.  People always expected great things of me.  My sister was always told that she couldn't do things that I could do because she's a girl.  And I enjoyed that.  I was a little twerp to her.  But everyone was awful to her in ways I couldn't see.  The older I get, the more my heart aches for the girl she was, and all she had to endure just trying to be a child in Texas in the 80s.  

Watch it if for no other reason than it might have positive effects on your relationships with women (even if you are a woman).  It's an entertaining and satisfying piece of film making.",1966,0.79,2024-01-06 19:00:54,641

Obviously the tone is very different and the whole thing runs on cartoon logic rather than paranormal scientific rigor, but the actual plot of the film is a dead ringer for a pataphysical SCP story.

Barbie and Ken are textbook examples of pataphysical SCPs - entities that originated as or abstractly represent fictional/cultural concepts that have breached the imaginary barrier that separates fiction and reality, presenting a very serious threat to normality both directly and in how their interactions with real life can affect the fiction they originate from.

And while they're not nearly as rigorous or competent as the Foundation, Mattel still reacts to this event exactly like the Foundation would, correctly predicting that Barbie and Ken bringing ideas from the real world back to their fiction of Barbieland will cause dramatic, retrocausal changes to the toyline and acting as quickly as possible to contain the two of them and return reality to baseline.",884,0.97,2024-01-06 23:13:06,70

Watched November 30th  
On a plane [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/)  
Directed by: Greta Gerwig  
Written by: Greta Gerwig, Noah Baumbach  
TSPDT: Unranked

114 minutes. It was a complete coincidence that *Barbie* was my 300th review of the year, but I’m glad I could match the spectacle with at least a personal milestone of writing. 

The movie was good. I liked it, it was cute. I’m actually a little disappointed because I took a deep breath when I went in and assumed I was going to have to do some mental gymnastics to defend the feminine stance in the film. But, there was nothing offensive in it. At all. This is just a sweet story for young girls that teaches them to learn who they are and not be co-dependent. 

I actually really liked the message, it was a very healthy perspective that we should not look to a partner for our own identity. I am sure we can all agree the world would be a healthier place if relationships were built on two healthy people coming together to encourage and support each other. 

I also felt it was a nice toy adaptation. It had the right amount of silly and zany, and set up the possibility for a franchise if they want to go that route. If the *Barbie* franchise could be one way Hollywood could bring up and coming female directors in to tell positive stories for young girls, I’m all for it. 

*Barbie* is the right kind of cultural phenomenon. Funny, inoffensive, empowering, makes everyone involved a lot of money, and lifts up movies and theaters as a whole for a few months after the release. It’s not a perfect film, but it’s a fun one and I’m glad it got made. ",3,1,2024-01-15 3:59:11,0

Critics Choice Predictions for the (theoretically) competitive categories,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/196lebk/critics_choice_predictions_for_the_theoretically/,"So I was going to post predictions for all categories like I normally do, but since almost all of them seem borderline locked, I’ll only post the ones where I’m predicting an upset or that I feel require commentary. Everything not listed here that I’m predicting is #1 on [Goldderby](https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/critics-choice-film-awards-2024-predictions/) and requires no explanation.

&#x200B;

**Best Supporting Actor**

**Ryan Gosling, Barbie**

(Alternate: Robert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer)

Gosling has such an insane amount of hype from Film Twitter and pundits that I think he’ll be the rare instance of passion prevailing over the Oscar favourite. If he loses here then I’d say he’s likely done for the Oscar, there’s so little excuse it’s not even funny.

&#x200B;

**Best Adapted Screenplay**

**Oppenheimer**

(Alternate: American Fiction)

Poor Things just feels like too inspired of a lock for Critics Choice to go for. Oppenheimer’s the critics frontrunner in Adapted and this is an easy place to check it off. If something were to upset I’d bet on American Fiction since it does feel like the socially conscious/funny topical satire that CC tends to like.

&#x200B;

**Best Film Ensemble**

**Barbie**

(Alternate: Oppenheimer)

I was really close to swapping these two and even might have, but Goldderby closed before I could lol. Anyways, I noticed there’s been an extremely low correlation between Ensemble and Picture, the last one being Spotlight, which only got three awards total. Obviously, they’re gonna love Oppenheimer, but will they love it so much that they give it a win even here when Barbie is more to their tastes? 

I also think Colour Purple absolutely makes sense as a surprise winner, since it fits the profile of the also-ran like Glass Onion last year and has been doing decently in the category. Not gonna take the risk and go for it though because ~~Goldderby closed super early for no reason~~ it has been underperforming basically the entire season and I’m not totally convinced it will have the passion to overcome Barbenheimer here.

&#x200B;

**Best Comedy Film**

**Barbie**

(Alternate: American Fiction)

This award serves as a consolation for not necessarily the strongest comedy contender that’s not winning BP, but just seemingly the most comedic film that’s somewhat on the map awards-wise (ie Bridesmaids, Crazy Rich Asians, Glass Onion). But Bottoms and No Hard Feelings most definitely are not awards adjacent like those movies and none of the Barbie alternatives are capital-C comedies like they go for. American Fiction might be an exception to that but I haven’t been able to watch it and confirm as much, so I’m just gonna have it as my alternate.

&#x200B;

**Best Animated Film**

**Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse**

(Alternate: The Boy and the Heron)

Boy and the Heron’s Globe win could definitely give it momentum for voters here to think it’s the new frontrunner and thus vote for it, but it’s clear that CC voters lean a lot more mainstream and will probably just go for Spider-Verse. 

&#x200B;

**Best Song**

**“I’m Just Ken,” Barbie**

Alternate: “What Was I Made For,” Barbie

Like Gosling the hype this has among Film Twitter types feels overwhelming, but in this case it’s even closer since they could easily just namecheck Eilish after the Globes win. Ultimately I still think the buzz around Barbie will duplicate here, since it seems like the people who love the movie go to Ken more than Made For.

&#x200B;

**Best Visual Effects**

**Oppenheimer**

(Alternate: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse)

TAR last year proved that voters will just check off their favourite movie in tech categories and I’d imagine many of them are just as, if not more apathetic to VFX. I could see a case for anything but Guardians and Mission: Impossible winning: Poor Things as the consolation prize, The Creator to predict the Oscars, and Spider-Verse as the surprise passion pick. Ultimately I don’t think there’ll be much consensus and the strongest film will win.",8,0.75,2024-01-14 17:41:31,1

"Jo Koy’s Golden Globes Barbie joke was intended to keep the movie relevant in media discourse, regardless of whether it won",https://www.reddit.com/r/LowStakesConspiracies/comments/1920vid/jo_koys_golden_globes_barbie_joke_was_intended_to/,"So the internet is awash with criticism towards Jo Koy’s joke that Barbie was just a film about a character known for big boobs and people are up in arms that it offends the very existence of the movie which tries to tackle the objectification of women.

Now, Oppenheimer stole the show at the Golden Globes, meaning it’s dominating headlines and media outlets, arguably “winning” the whole Barbenheimer competition, if winning is measured in awards. The controversy around Koy’s joke (which allegedly multiple people read and approved), blatantly was going to offend fans of the movie as it so obviously challenged everything the movie stood for. The joke was therefore used so that even if Barbie lost at the Globes, it would stay relevant, selling more toys, receiving more attention and potentially leading more people to watch it.",7,0.68,2024-01-09 0:24:39,2

Why don’t The Muppets host the Oscars?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/196zfjm/why_dont_the_muppets_host_the_oscars/,"There’s so many people involved in this year that exude Muppet energy, the muppets would fit in right with the rest of them. Paul Giamatti would definitely be a serious character that the muppets use for comedic relief. DiCaprio fulfills the role of Michael Caine who would play the Muppet stuff 100% straight and serious and not acknowledge a single muppet. Gladstone has literally been a teacher on Crash Course so you know she’d fit right in on Sesame Street. Gonzo would definitely do an Oppenheimer bomb joke which would make Nolan do a lil giggle or two. We don’t even need a stand up comedian as Fozzie Bear could do some real ol slam dunks with stuff like “Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie spent $100 million dollars on Barbieland, yet I bought a Barbie for only $40, how poor budgeting is that?! Waka Waka!”

Barbie,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/195ts9i/barbie/,"I just finished watching the Barbie movie and god what an amazing movie I'm definitely going to rewatch it a few more times to figure out what makes it work so good and do a film analysis of it but it's also pretty bitter sweet for me. This isn't me trying to center myself in a story about womanhood but it's just a bit painful to understand that I won't understand or feel the message of the movie as deeply as I could just by the very nature of who and what I am. It's frustrating to be cut off from that experience and those feelings just because, for lack of a better term, I wasn't born *right*

I could achieve everything I set out for as a genderfluid person and still miss out on an entire half of my existence because I don't get that lived experience. I could achieve perfect androgyny, I could present perfectly femme or perfectly masc, and it still won't matter because I won't have the experience of womanhood. I know this is just something I and practically every other genderfluid person has to struggle with and come to terms with but it's just so painful to understand I could be ken but I will never even have a chance to truly be barbie

Edit: yes I understand being genderfluid is a wonderful experience and I would not want to be anything else. I'm whining about the fact I will never have the same lived experience as a person who is afab and thus will never have the experience of womanhood and frankly telling me ""you get an experience far fewer others get"" is pretty shitty when I'm crying about an entire half of being genderfluid",12,0.84,2024-01-13 17:56:02,2

Top Gun: Maverick and Barbie are two movies that surpassed all their expectations and became some of the highest grossing movies of all time with nearly $1.5 billion each.

 However, they were both definitely one time phenomenons that would be difficult to replicate, and demand for sequels isn’t particularly high, so it is safe to assume a steep drop for them, even if they are still likely to be profitable. 

Assuming both of these actually got made, which one do you think would see a smaller drop from its predecessor?

Looking for a detailed roleplay partner

Hi everyone i'm looking for someone to play as the beautiful Margot Robbie for me in a Blowjob scenario. If you like Margot and can play her well full of her personality is a bonus. Margot is perfect for BBC and she must be such a size queen

Scene 1 - Margot the hot business woman - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/938506947399929916/1183798414618673202/mr16.jpg?ex=6589a52f&is=6577302f&hm=49a7eb4964efc130beb3bc859e222829190c02376f8f0e3bb0b60e6eee947875&

What i'm thinking its Margot is in her Lucky Chap office one day and is on her laptop sending emails, and video calls just generally her being business woman like bossy a bit bitchy. She is in the office doing some business work for her company and some Barbie promo campaign documents

I can either be a new intern working in your office & you have heard rumors i am very well hung and would like to see for yourself and you admit to being into black cocks in blunt way. Or i can be a black guy you see on a regular basis to get your BBC fix or.

In this scenario you as Margot would be in full control like you could say to me to get naked as you close the blinds and lock the door. Or i could get buzzed thru to your office from one door. Then before i enter your room i take my 9 inch BBC out and walk in on you catching you off guard as you finish off a phone call or typing away on your laptop sending an email, as you signal me over with your other hand/finger.

Many ways we could play this out and i'm open to your suggestions ideas for the scene so we can play it out. As Business woman Margot is really hot to think about and her getting a nice Big Black Cock is really hot to imagine her doing her office on a break or just during day in the office.

Scene 2

Margot goes into a quiet sauna thinking she is all alone being her usual happy fun self. It's a private sauna located in LA and they have kept it open just for her as they think everyone has left. Margot would be so much fun in this setup as i can imagine she would be extremely verbal and vocal during it and very flirty and teasing before the blowjob action as well as during it I can imagine Margot walking into the sauna and not realizing there’s another guy in there. Closing her eyes and unwrapping her towel to expose her nude body. After a while, she sees my large BBC sticking out opposite her. Margot apologizing, thinking that she was the only one in there. Telling him that she prefers to be in the sauna without any clothes as she introduces herself. Both of them casually chatting to each other while naked, slowly getting turned on by each other’s bodies. They can be chatting naked opposite each other in the sauna. My cock getting harder at the sight of Margot's naked body and her perky tits though from Margot’s face it’s clear she doesn’t mind at all seeing the naked hung stud and his massive black cock opposite her. maybe it could be taking place where the production for one of her movies is taking place in LA like Barbie. The sauna could be located on one of the streets near to where they are filming and she is not needed on set for a few hours when our meet and blowjob takes place. As its an exclusive sauna for the rich and famous of LA where celebs get high priority over other people

Scene 3 

Margot has come to the campus to do a talk for the film students and a little promo. She has been shown around by one of the senior lecturers who helped organize your visit. You go off around the campus mainly backstage behind the stage ahead of your speech later today. You see a laptop in a side room & you have a look at some of my work you then click on the pics and see several Blacked gifs and pics fakes of yourself, which you find hot to look at & the creativity of them and how real and accurate they are making you flustered and horny seeing them. I’m unaware you are there looking when I come back from a quick shower from a door opposite this room in nothing but a towel and an obvious big bulge when we meet. You ask me about the blacked fake pics captions gifs on my laptop and acknowledge my big bulge under my towel. Maybe you ask if they are my work or where i got them from we chat and flirt causing the big tent under the towel as i try and cover it up to no avail which leads to you asking to see it and eventually a blowjob

Scene 4

I'm a fan who has won an exclusive competition to spend 2 days with you during the Barbie promo. So the first day i spent with you was at one of the actual Barbie events red carpet. Where we did not spend much time together we chatted but not much as you was so busy and your husband was with you. Today is the 2nd day and its at your L.A Mansion and your husband is out of town for the day I spend time at your place with you being a great host getting to know me my interests how I got into you, my fav movie roles, etc photo shoots outfits. As the day goes on we have been flirting with each other, you teasing me at times. Where you accidentally spill some wine onto me and it goes over my trousers you go to dry it with a towel and its where you feel my big bulge in my pants much to your interest suggest i take them off and let them dry & that I can wear some trousers you have laying around. You go off to find the trousers in one of your rooms 5-10 mins pass. In that time i have gone for a wander and i'm casually stood looking at your awards etc down one of the hallways. My big black cock pointing upwards as i look at them when you step out from one of the rooms and see me stood there. My cock impressing you as you try and act composed but clearly very flustered by my BBC. You then randomly comment on it rather vocally about its size not expecting it etc which then leads to the blowjob in one of your rooms

I will play as a well built black guy with a slim toned muscular body i'm 5ft 11 with a 9 inch BBC

If you are interested in playing as Margot for me send me a pic of what you will look like in the scene. I'm also open to any of your suggestions or ideas for the set up to discuss so that we can rp.

I have other ideas too if you are not keen on this

Does anyone know of any film where the most common rating to give it is a 9/10 (4.5 stars)?,https://i.redd.it/fhq6yb4zx3cc1.jpeg,"I was recently having a discussion about this with a friend, and how great films will usually have many 8/10 and 10/10 ratings (4 and 5 stars respectively), but then the amount of 9/10 ratings will be significantly lower than the two (e.g. Barbie having 300k less 9/10 ratings than 8/10 and 10/10). I’m thinking there isn’t a deep reason for this, and perhaps it is simply a case of users more commonly landing on a full star rating, as opposed to adding an additional half star. I’m not really sure. Or maybe movie watchers will just more often feel a film was an 8/10 or a 10/10, and that 9/10 films are just harder to find. I’m not really sure. But anyway, can anyone find a film where on the curve, a film’s most common rating to receive was a 9/10 (4.5 stars)? 

Thank you for reading, and happy discussing the 9/10 rating :)",146,0.93,2024-01-13 1:09:15,47
Barbie Movie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/18vomp5/barbie_movie/,"I just had an amazing epiphany with the beginning of the new year! I think I figured myself out, and it’s insane and weird and cool! 
I was watching the movie Barbie in the hours leading to the end of this year and I felt like I related to Barbie a lot. 
I felt like I was Barbie, in the way that she was so confused with emotions, how she is sad, how she gets tired, how she can have a bad day. 
Because for me, I think there is a part of me that is very machine- like , a data collector, a date analyser, someone who doesn’t understand or know how to process real emotion. 
But then there is another part of me who feels things, who is extremely empathetic, who is very human. 
So my life felt like a series of traumatic experiences, the experience of understanding what it feels like to be human, to accept it. 
Because it’s very confusing knowing that I am not happy all the time, or high functional all the time; to be mundane and do things that makes you less than perfect. 
And all my life I struggled with understanding emotion. Like recently I was speaking to my therapist and I whispered to him in a very shameful voice “ I think I don’t love my parents because sometimes when they call me I feel like it’s a chore to talk to them or want to call them back” and he told me “ but that’s okay, everyone feels that sometimes it’s a chore to talk to others” and for me I was confused because I thought that if you love someone then you have to be there for them and constantly think of them even if they are not there because that’s what love is like in books and in movies therefore I thought if I don’t show that then that means I don’t love them even though I do. 
And for me now it’s the acceptance and the understanding that emotion is not just happy or sad or angry or excited. 
It’s understanding that the definition written in the dictionary is not what emotion means. That emotion is a spectrum and you can feel something without it being so literal because that’s what you read or understood emotion to be like.

Trying to find outfit from Barbie and the Rockers Film,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/194a4rg,"Hi Everyone! I posted a few months ago looking for specific outfits from the animated Barbie and the Rockers: Out of This World video. I got a ton of help and found one my holy grails, and I'm back for more help! 

I've done my best to look, but I cannot for the life of me find a doll or fashion pack that includes a dress like this. So I have 2 questions!

1. Does anyone know of a doll or fashion pack that resembles this outfit?

2. Does anyone have any recommendations for a doll clothes seamstress/maker that could potentially custom make this dress? 

Thank you so much! I cannot wait to post my collection of Barbie and the Rockers movie looks when it is complete!",13,0.94,2024-01-11 19:28:57,2

Do they all follow the same script?,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/19557tb/do_they_all_follow_the_same_script/,"Please no stealing my posts.

You can see my previous posts about my MIL in my profile if you'd like more context. But if you want the TL;DR: DH, LO, and I used to live about 90 min from the ILs and about 4.5 hours from my hometown. DH is the youngest of three and the only boy. Our LO is MIL/FILs only grand daughter although they have several grandsons. LO is my dads only grandchild.

The end of Oct we moved to my hometown, so now we're 6+ hours from ILs. When we said we were moving and that my dad would be watching LO while we work, MIL lost her mind and said some awful stuff about my dad. After that I completely dropped the rope. In the past we would alternate holidays between my family and the ILs. This was the year to spend Christmas with my family. Because of what MIL said, and because they are now so far away, we didn't go to my ILs for Thanksgiving.

Before we moved, when we were still 90min away from MIL, we'd go visit around once a week on average. And MIL would come see us every week or two. But since we moved away in Oct, MIL hasn't seen LO. 

We did go back to DH's hometown for New Years though so we could attend his cousins New Years Eve party. It's the first grown up thing we've done w/out LO since she was born. We told MIL that we'd be in town and agreed to have dinner with them one night. We were VERY clear that LO would NOT be coming (she stayed with my dad) and also VERY clear that we would NOT be spending the night at MILs. Instead we were staying with one of DH's cousins and his wife. They are similar age to us and we've always been super close to them.

So the Saturday before NYE we went to MILs house for dinner. After she opened the door to let us in, she put on this big show of looking around and then asked where LO was. We reminded her that we had been very clear that LO was not coming. She started sniffling and tearing up and said she had hoped we would change our minds, then started on about how much she missed LO and how LO must be missing her grandma (MIL). It made for an awkward dinner. After dinner she told us to bring our suitcases in and we had to remind her AGAIN that we were not spending the night at her house. This prompted more weeping and hand wringing.

The NYE party was a blast and we drove home NY day without seeing MIL again. We had thought about having brunch with her on the 1st, but DH and I just couldn't deal with more of her guilt tripping and passive aggressiveness.

Last weekend MIL sent DH a wall of text saying how much she missed him, how important the relationship between a little boy and his mother is and how she was always the first woman in DH's life. Then she went on about how much she loves LO and misses her so much. And how us moving away has broken MILs heart because now MIL won't get to do all the important things grandmas are supposed to do for their grand daughters. She talked about how she felt abandoned by DH but that she'd always love him because DH would always be her little boy.  It was just a word vomit of cringy stuff like that. The whole text was packed full of ICK.

So a couple days ago, MIL send both DH and I a message saying that she'd bought some really cute Barbie birthday decorations for LO's 2nd birthday next month. MIL also said she wanted to order a Barbie sheet cake for LOs birthday party. MIL has also told us that we need to take LO to have the party in their hometown (6+ hours away)  so all of DH's family can attend. Why do these women thing they can decide what we are doing and how we live our lives? They got their turn, now it our turn.

The thing is, LO has no idea who Barbie is. We haven't bought her any Barbie stuff, we haven't watched any Barbie movies or shows, nothing. LOL LOVES animals and loves zoos so we're planning on a zoo animal theme for the party. DH has my back and said we can do whatever we want. So I'll probably just donate the Barbie stuff to goodwill or something and we'll go ahead with the zoo theme.  And there is no way we're driving all that way for a 2nd bday party.  We're having the party at my dads house (since we live in a small 2 bedroom apartment) and we're only inviting close family. MIL/FIL/both SILs and their family are all invited to come.

I know MIL is going to make a big deal about it, but honestly its just a long drive to where they live, and I don't want to go all that way for just a weekend.  Especially not with a 2 year old.  And if they do come down here for the party, I know she's going to throw a fit and start pouting that we aren't using the barbie stuff she bought.   OMG, I am perfectly happy to tell MIL to say in her lane, it just gets old having to constantly do it. And then putting up with the snide remarks, passive aggressive attitude, pouting and whining makes it worse.  I swear, at almost 2 years old, LO is way more emotionally mature then MIL.

Ugh. I just wanted to get that off my chest. I know DH has my back, but I feel bad constantly complaining to him about his mom.

Kudos to Gerwig for her classy response to Jo Koy,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1934zpj/kudos_to_gerwig_for_her_classy_response_to_jo_koy/,"When given the opportunity to throw scorn on Koy for his tasteless ""Barbie"" joke, she manages to pivot to a broader discussion of the doll, its impact on girls and to praise Ruth Handler again.

>Well, he’s not wrong. She’s the first doll that was mass produced with breasts, so he was right on. And you know, I think that so much of the project of the movie was unlikely because it is about a plastic doll… Barbie by her very construction has no character, no story, she’s there to be projected upon.

>The insight that [Barbie creator] Ruth Handler had when she was watching her daughter play with baby dolls, is she realised, ‘My daughter doesn’t want to pretend to be a mother. She wants to pretend to be a grown woman.'",251,0.92,2024-01-10 10:10:20,103

Our childhood Barbies,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/193qcyf,"I apologize for the rambling post. I'm 51 and fell in love with Barbies when I got my first one, the 1979 Beauty Secrets doll. My sister and I loved them so much. We would memorize the Sears Wish Book  that came out every fall marking all our favorite toys we wanted for Christmas and wore out the Barbie pages for sure. Our parents couldn't afford much but we always managed to get some things we asked for each year. One of the best Barbie gifts we received were matching townhouses. When I went off to college, our mom decided to change around our bedrooms around and all our Barbie stuff was put in trash bags in a storage room. Our treasures were gathering dust and mold for over 30 years until I finally got inspired to do something after seeing the Barbie movie last year. Here are our townhouses, not perfect but they're standing. We have a mix of old Arco furniture, Mattel stuff and some new things from Amazon. We have six 80s dolls and a couple of 90s dolls. I've been trying to find some of our earlier dolls that we must have ruined or gave away at some point because we have lots of room for more. I just wanted to share because I have gotten so much from this community over the last few months. It's good to find a group who share a passion and who willingly share their expertise. I've learned a lot and I enjoy seeing what you guys are doing and collecting. I've reclaimed a part of my childhood that even today makes me happy and is so therapeutic. Thank you all for sharing with me!",169,0.99,2024-01-11 2:18:39,13

Daddy’s Weakness Part 21,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/195qb8e/daddys_weakness_part_21/,"Leslie and her father stood on doorstep Saturday morning, waving goodbye to her mother as the Uber took her to the airport. 

“So peanut , what’s the movie going to be tonight?  The Barbie movie for the fifteenth time?” Edgar joked closing the door behind them as they went inside. 

“Well, dad. I thought we could do movie night TOMORROW night. “ she said, clasping her hands behind her back and swishing herself back and forth. 

“Oh, why?” 

“Well I wanted to hang out with some friends tonight. Here. In the basement. “

“Friends?” He said suspiciously.

“Yea just a few, maybe like 10? We would stay in the basement, have a few drinks, play music.”

“Leslie I may look it but I am not stupid. You just used more words to describe a party. Just because your mother is gone does not mean the rules went with her. No parties. ESPECIALLY none with alcohol.”

“Alcohol and drugs.” Leslie added.

Her father only fixed with her a long suffering look. 

“Daddy…”she cooed, approaching him which generated an immediately hesitant look from him, “I REALLY want to have this party. I promise we won’t be trouble. And I am sure you and I can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial.”

Leslie closed the distance, reaching out to take his hand she stroked it like she was calming a skittish horse. 

“Daddy, it’s really important to me that this happen.” Particularly since she already invited everyone, “You want to be the best daddy don’t you?”

“Leslie…how can I say yes to this? Drinking? Drugs? Come on. Let’s just watch a movie and maybe we can do a fashion show…”

“Oh I was thinking more than a fashion show…” Leslie said demurely causing a look to flash across her fathers face that was so sudden and shocked she almost burst out laughing. 

“More than a fashion…” her father managed, the words coming out in a garbled babble.

“Well yea…if you’ll let me have my party .” she said. 

“What’s more than a fashion show mean.” He said, suspicious now.

“Tut tut. First, we agree that the party is on? That you’ll help me host?”

“Well,” Edgar paused, his eyes going distant, “ the last time I made a blind agreement like this it didn’t exactly work out in my favor.”

“Oh, you mean last time when you came so much to my body that you stained the changing room floor?” Leslie smirked. 

“Language young lady.” Edgar said absently, still in thought. “Fine. I’ll help you host. Now what’s ‘more than a fashion show’ mean.”

Leslie squealed, releasing his hand so she could leap up and down. 

“Thankyouthankyouthankyou!” She said, leaping into his arms and planting a very un-daughterly kiss hard on his mouth. His erection was already stabbing in her hip. 

“I need you to go to the liquor store and get a handle of vodka, something good like Ketel. And Jimmy like rum so get one of those, again nothing cheap. “

“Woah woah, I’m getting the vodka ? I didn’t agree to furnish this party. And who’s Jimmy?”

The last carried a hint of jealousy. 

“Well you agreed to host the party with me and as cohost YOUR job is to get the booze. And snacks.” She paused. “Jimmy is just a friend.”

Her father’s face began to grow a shade of red as his jaw clenched. 

“Daaaaaad.” She groaned, “ You are CUTE when you are jealous. Jimmy is for Lisa, not me. I don’t like highschool boys. Too silly and young. But this party WILL make me super cool. So make sure to get the good stuff!”

Edgar’s features softened and he was about to turn to leave but stopped. 

“Wait. I’m not going anywhere until I find out what I get out of this.” He was facing her now, arms across his chest. 

Leslie looked at her watch. 

“Fine. We have some time I guess.” She moved closer to him again pressing herself against him and running her hand across his chest. 

“I was thinking of putting those dance lessons you got me to good use. Would you like a dance daddy?”",12,1,2024-01-13 15:22:48,0

4. Across the Spider-Verse
5. Barbie
6. Anatomy of a Fall

10. Guardians of the Galaxy 3

Who Are the Coattail Nominations Gonna Be?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1957cb5/who_are_the_coattail_nominations_gonna_be/,"By no stretch does it need this but I can see Oppenheimer getting a costume design nom. The costumes are fine but it's basic early to mid 20th century stuff and there's several movies from this year that did that better. But it's probably winning Best Picture and I can see it getting nominations damn near everywhere. 

Barbie doesn't need score, I like the score, but it doesn't need a nomination here. It's probably getting one just reading the tea leaves. If Across the Spider-Verse misses score for this I'll be pissed. 

Killers of the Flower Moon is getting into song. I do not really think it needs it although if that means Lily isn't the sole Indigenous person getting nominated from this film then okay. I'm also sticking with someone from Killers getting into Supporting Actress hopefully edging our Jodie Foster please God. I think both some of the outrage over the exclusion of certain actors from SAG ensemble might just give enough people cause to slot in Cara Jade Myers into their five. I thought it'd be Tantoo Cardinal but maybe not. 

American Fiction getting an editing nom is something I feel like they'll wanna do because of how it handles some of the more comedic sequences especially the ending. It's very good comedic editing. I wouldn't be upset at a nom here.",8,0.83,2024-01-12 22:10:53,26

29 [F4M] #Texas #DFW seeking my knight in shining armour,https://www.reddit.com/r/cglpersonals/comments/196vq46/29_f4m_texas_dfw_seeking_my_knight_in_shining/,"And I’m back in the f**king building again 😔 I’ve made a post before and I was met with disappointment after meeting someone but Yknow, trial and error. Definitely starting to think my ‘knight in shining armour’ doesn’t exist. But as they say, the third times the charm. 

I’m B, 29 and in the DFW area so I’d prefer someone close because long distance is rough, however I am still open to the right person. I’ve had a lot of bad luck with partners, all things considered the dating scene here and pretty much everywhere is garbage. I’ve been lured into relationships only to be used and discarded once a man got what he wanted and I’m tired of it. I am very beautiful, i’m aware of that, I get told that a lot; but I would like a partner to see past my looks and want to be with me for who I am not just to get into my pants. As a woman, I’m sure other women know how frustrating this is because it seems like a lot of guys are like this; I’m still trying to hold onto hope that one day I’ll meet that right person. Anyways I’m sorry for rambling, I’ve been in a few DDLG relationships and like I mentioned before, things haven’t worked out for me. I turn 30 this spring and hope that this year, the year of the dragon, will be my year 🙏🏽 that I’ll meet the perfect companion, I know he (Kylo Ren) is out there somewhere. 

Thank you if you’ve read my little rant this far 😂 I am a nerd, I love Star Wars, DC and Marvel. I’m an artsy person, pink is my favourite colour and I often get called Barbie by my friends because I’m blonde. All that in one package sounds very silly when put into words but I’m a very fun and bubbly person. I wake up early and work out 4-5 times a week, go to yoga 2-3 times as well, I eat very healthy for the most part but we all have cheat days every now and then. I LOVE cooking it is one of my favourite past times and overall just enjoy having someone to hang out with and try new things out in the world. 

As a little, I am very soft and small (and I am small I’m 5’3”) but I’ll give you big doe eyes to try and get whatever I want. I love princess movies a lot, frozen 2, the little mermaid and beauty and the beast are my top 3. Im usually very good and do what I’m told, I want someone that likes having control and keeping things in control to make sure I stay on top of things to get me through my daily life. Im also very submissive but if you get to the point of discussing those things with me kinks and whatnot will be shared in private. Please be over 30, I apologize but men in their 20s usually don’t work for me. 

Alright I’ll stop talking, thank you again if you made it this far! 😅 hopefully look forward to hearing from you 🫶🏽♥️

Edit: If you’re poly stay away from me, I’m not here to be your third nor do I ever want to be. I’m monogamous and want something serious I don’t enjoy being a plaything. Thanks. ",3,0.64,2024-01-15 1:00:46,2
SAG NOMINATIONS - FULL (FILM) + THOUGHTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/193an6f/sag_nominations_full_film_thoughts/,"Looking back on my Predictions from last night which are here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/192pqlp/sag\_predictions\_for\_tomorrow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/192pqlp/sag_predictions_for_tomorrow/)

I did Pretty well, Only 7 wrong, so on average 1 miss per category.

**Hot Takes:**

* The Color Purple did make it here! With Danielle Brooks but no Fantasia. Seems like it could get 2 Oscar nominations for Picture and Brooks
* May December completely shut out! If it needed to have done well anywhere it was here and not getting any nominations here reaffirmed my suspicion that it wasn't an industry movie but a critics / independent spirits movie. I'm taking it out of my predictions entirely.
* No Melton with Dafoe getting in means that Poor Things Supporting Actors are strong! I'm predicting the my 5 I've always said Dafoe / Downey / De Niro / Gosling / Ruffalo with Sterling K Brown as a dark horse.
* Supporting Actress is a little wild. I can see Ferrera making it in over Cruz at the Oscars.
* Domingo getting in over DiCaprio is very SAG, they love Netflix
* In Actress I can see the 4 minus Annette and Huller taking that slot
* Sad but not completely surprised that Past Lives missed here entirely. 

**ENSEMBLE:**

* American Fiction
* Barbie
* The Color Purple
* Killers of the Flower Moon
* Oppenheimer

Commentary: I predicted Air / Saltburn they went with KOTFM and AF)

**ACTRESS:**

* Annette Bening, Nyad
* Lily Gladstone, KOTFM
* Emma Stone, Barbie
* Carey Mulligan, Maestro
* Margot Robbie, Barbie

Commentary: I only got 1 wrong, had Fantasia getting in over Annette

**ACTOR:**

* Bradley Cooper, Maestro
* Colman Domingo Rustin
* Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer
* Paul Giamatti, The Holdovers
* Jeffrey Wright, American Fiction

Commentary: I only got 1 wrong here as well, I had DiCaprio over Colman

**SUPPORTING ACTRESS:**

* Da’Vine Joy Randolph, The Holdovers
* Emily Blunt, Oppenheimer
* Danielle Brooks, The Color Purple
* Jodie Foster, Nyad
* Penelope Cruz, Ferrari

Commentary: I got two wrong, I had Ferrera and Pike over Foster and Cruz

**SUPPORTING ACTOR:**

* Sterling K. Brown, American Fiction
* Willem Dafoe, Poor Things
* Robert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer
* Ryan Gosling, Barbie
* Robert De Niro, KOTFM

Commentary: I only got 1 wrong, had Ruffalo over Brown

I think Supporting Actress will have a passion nominee,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/193w2da/i_think_supporting_actress_will_have_a_passion/,"So the Best Supporting Actress nominees are looking pretty weak, as while Randolph, Blunt, Brooks, and Foster seem in, that fifth slot is a question mark. But after thinking about it, I personally believe that the slot will be filled up by a passion nominee, who gets in by getting rave reviews despite not doing well in precursors. My reasoning for this is that none of the other competitors feel right to me as nominees:

* Moore didn't get SAG, is snubable at BAFTA, and is in a movie that's looking pretty weak.
* Cruz only has SAG and is in a movie with no buzz.
* Pike is in a divisive movie and she missed CC and SAG. 
* Ferrera missed places that loved Barbie like GG and SAG, plus I don't think there's any real passion for her performance.
* McAdams missed everything, including CC which she should've definitely gotten.
* Huller is in a movie that isn't the type of movie that usually gets acting nominations
* Henson and Davis are both done, they couldn't even get anything, not even GG or SAG.

So looking at the competition, I believe that on Oscar nomination morning, there will be a surprise nomination who gets in on pure passion. Of course, it could just be someone normal and then this post will age like milk. ",3,0.61,2024-01-11 7:32:48,14

COMMENTARY:

Don't feel great about Spider-Verse, but I'm not convinced about the alternates. The Color Purple has shat the bed with the guilds and has lost steam at the box office. They don't do international films unless it's frontrunner for Best Picture. Air feels too gone. I'm done getting my hopes up for The Iron Claw.

On the Supporting Actor race: Is RDJ really the best of the year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/19409qn/on_the_supporting_actor_race_is_rdj_really_the/,"I've been closely following the Oscar race for a while now, but this is the first year I've been so deeply invested in it. I refrained from judging the supporting performances until I had watched all the contenders, and now that I have, I find myself perplexed by the overwhelming support for RDJ's performance. 

There's no denying that RDJ delivered a very good performance, but in a year with such strong contenders, where other performances played much more important roles in their respective movies, I'm genuinely surprised to see him leading the race.

De Niro, for instance, delivered one of the best performances of his career, a truly legendary portrayal.  Gosling's role as Ken is noteworthy and Mark Ruffalo's performance surpasses RDJ's in my opinion. Additionally, I could make a case for Sessa and Melton, who delivered better and more impactful performances for their movies.

 While I understand the influence of a compelling narrative, it seems like RDJ's potential win could be more of a recognition of his career rather than this performance. I love RDJ and the way he has been campaigning thus far. However, the man didn't even give the best supporting performance in his own movie. 

I acknowledge that taste is subjective, but I'm curious to know if the admiration for RDJ is truly that substantial in the US, because Even after dragging many friends to watch 'Barbie,' 'KOTFM,' 'May December,' and 'Oppenheimer,' they unanimously agree that the supporting performances of Melton, Gosling, and De Niro are head and shoulders above RDJ's.

My entire immediate family is way too judgmental,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/195h1cr/my_entire_immediate_family_is_way_too_judgmental/,"Tonight my family went out for dinner. As we were approaching the door to the restaurant, I stopped to hold the door for a man and his 3-4 y/o son. One parent still behind me, but I wanted let them go first because it’s -13° C where we are, plus snowy and windy. This guy’s kid wasn’t wearing a coat but my split second thought was, “sometimes kids don’t do what you want. Choose your battles, etc.” My parent says loudly as they’re walking through the door “No jacket?!”, to which I did an awkward laugh like, “ha, kids right?” until I saw my parent’s face and realized they were serious and judging this dude. The man then turns and says, “as we were walking the 10 steps from our car I thought, ‘someone is going to think I’m an awful parent. I didn’t put on his coat because car seat manufacturers advise no winter jackets since many are slippery. I figured it was a few steps from the car but I knew someone would think I was a bad dad.” Then the guy goes to get his pick up order and parent says nothing else. Good for that guy for saying something to my parent but I felt really awful. He was right AND it’s also none of our damn business! I didn’t think he was a bad father at all.

That’s just the night’s first example. We were there for an hour, tops, and here are a few conversation highlights: “Of course someone opens the fucking door and lets the cold in!” (The door was at least 5 tables away. Also, it’s an exit), “I hate blue cheese, why would anyone put it on a Cobb salad.” (Menu clearly states blue cheese as an ingredient. It’s your fault for not noticing when you ordered), “I’m so sick of that stupid Barbie movie. What a waste of resources” (person hasn’t seen or read anything about the movie)”, “mushrooms are evil and disgusting” (I love mushrooms, a known fact), “PC games are better than console games” (person hasn’t played a console game). “Books that are close to real life are boring and not worth reading.” (At least 3 of us like non-fiction and life-parallel fiction), “that game is so stupid and way too slow.” (About a game someone else was talking about really enjoying). 

From this post, it sounds like my family members were hungry, maybe tired, probably cranky, but no, every time we get together the conversation is like this and it’s just so freakin exhausting.",2,1,2024-01-13 5:55:18,2
"Yes, it was really that bad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jokoy/comments/192e4qc/yes_it_was_really_that_bad/,"Jo Koy deserves the backlash he is getting for his horrible, cringe-worthy GG monologue. Koy elevates Oppenheimer as being based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel and contrasts it to Barbie that he claims is based on a plastic doll with big boobs. Things are funny when there is a basis in truth. In this case, he either didn’t see the movies, didn’t understand the movies, or is just an —-.

The Barbie movie is about Barbie rejecting the plastic, idealized version of herself, refusing to get in the box, and embracing her personal power, her flaws, and her authentic self. She also empowers Ken to realize that he does not need to define himself through the admiration of a woman or within the context of a relationship and to love who he is (he is “Ken enough”).

In contrast, Oppenheimer, though based on real events, is a misogynistic male fantasy world. It fails the Bechdel test, which requires a movie to have 2 women that speak to each other about something other than men. That happens in the real world, including undoubtedly among the female physicists that actually worked on the Manhattan Project, but not in the Oppenheimer movie. Koy cluelessly observes that women only exist in the Oppenheimer movie to prove that male scientists “get laid.” True statement about the movie but not about reality, so very much not funny. 

Koy was not too edgy or too politically incorrect and he did not simply misread the crowd. He wasn’t funny because he is stupid and humor must be clever to be good.",12,0.66,2024-01-09 12:58:25,6

PGA Predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/194yfns/pga_predictions/,"I know it’ll only be a few hours until we find out but I might as well post what I think’s getting in.

1. Oppenheimer

2. Killers of the Flower Moon

3. Barbie

4. Poor Things

5. The Holdovers

6. American Fiction

7. Maestro

8. Past Lives

9. The Colour Purple 

1.0 Air

Alternate: Saltburn

Other possibilities: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, May December, Anatomy of a Fall, The Iron Claw, NYAD, Asteroid City

As most would argue, these last two slots seem completely up in the air and so I’m not really confident in either of them. 

The Colour Purple is severely underperforming with guilds but the SAG Ensemble nod could show that it still has some life, and it does have solid critic and audience scores. If it can get in here then I think there’s still a chance it makes the Oscars but otherwise it’s completely out.

Air makes sense as a crowdpleasing baity movie but it’s also beyond dead. Still, part of me thinks it’s a Glass Onion situation where it manages to claw its way to a slot in part because of low competition.

But I’m really struggling to find alternatives here.

Saltburn had a lot of buzz after it hit Prime but I simply don’t buy that Amazon/MGM is capable of getting 3 movies nominated at a major precursor. They couldn’t even get their priority in last year. If it gets in it’ll be at the expense of Air and even then, why would PGA go for this gross and divisive movie over that?

Spider-Verse has passion but it’s also underperforming, and even though PGA isn’t as biased against superhero films as everywhere else they definitely are with animated movies (the last was BP-nominated Toy Story 3). 

May December’s only here because maybe being Netflix’s second priority is enough but after it bombing with SAG I’d be really surprised if it happened. If they didn’t go for any other Haynes film, why would they go for this one? If it shows up here then it could potentially be back in the BP nom conversation.

With how weak the last few slots are I could see a case for Anatomy of a Fall passion pulling through, but otherwise there’s no reason to think they’d bite when they rarely do with foreign films.

Iron Claw I guess has a shot? But it built buzz far too late and isn’t even A24’s second priority. 

NYAD could also secretly be Netflix’s 2nd priority and is their only contending movie to be a crowdpleaser, but I’m also writing this off because I can’t think of the last time they went for something this off the map.

Finally, I’ve heard Asteroid City tossed around purely because it has the highest PTA of the year like The Whale did before its surprise nom, but other than that there’s no reason to predict this and it has basically everything going against it.",5,0.78,2024-01-12 15:59:20,4
(UPDATE) I 22m thinking of leaving my 24m friend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/195jjsr/update_i_22m_thinking_of_leaving_my_24m_friend/,"Heres a little backstory about my friend from a previous post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/15d65h3/i\_22m\_thinking\_of\_leaving\_my\_24m\_friend/
  

  
So I continued being friends with him after that post, I felt that things were alright for the most part but there were still quite a bit of problems when being friends with him. So last year there were so many movies I wanted to see with him and a lot of our friends (Megan, Little Mermaid, Mario, Barbie) not one of those we had seen or I was even asked to watch with. This rubbed me the wrong way and as I really was looking forward to be spending time with my so called friends and was not even asked to see these movies with them and I know for a fact that he saw them with people and not invite me. It became a common thing for me to not be invited to hang outs or parties when it came to him. He often chose people over me, or would also continue to neglect adding me to gatherings. I have talked to him about but he would always brush it off and make it so that I am overreacting to it. He would also tell me to make new friends, mainly just becuase he really does not want to hang with me. Most of the times I suggest hanging he'll not want to, or only do it when it is convient for him. In one of our last hang outs he got drunk and really targeted me hard, by just saying some dumb shit to me infront of everyone and I nearly crided and was so close to leaving that hang out. I am often a target to his emotional bullying to which I had to always delt with (he does this with some other friends to but I am clearly the main target) But as last year was ending and I was continued to not be invited to things such as parties, clubbing or even just getting food, I just decided to stop engaging with him. I have not spoken a word to him in weeks, and have avoided him at work. I honestly felt for a lot of last year I was watering dead flowers, our friendship was ruined and I had to just end it myself. I decided to start a new leaf and make this year solely about myself, it may be selfish to some but I am tired of being a people pleaser. I'm not even sure he has noticed that I have stopped being friends with him or acknowledges that I am not speaking to him. I don't think that explaining how I felt last year to him would go anywhere, he said so himself to me that he wants things his way and that he is always right so for me to explain myself would basically be talking to a wall.",4,1,2024-01-13 8:36:26,9

CMV: Barbie will have a much bigger impact on female lead blockbusters than The Marvels.,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191zd8y/cmv_barbie_will_have_a_much_bigger_impact_on/,"A lot of people point to the marvels as a example of why female lead blockbusters fail and why disney will stop making ""woke content"". I felt this was very far fetched the marvels had a lot going against it. Its the latest in the line of marvel films that were already mediocre its also very generic and paint by numbers. Thor Love and thunder Ant Man Quanamanium and Secret Invasion really destroyed the general audiences desire to see more marvel movies. 

I also don't the Marvels is a particularly ""woke"" movie sure the leads are all women and the villain is a woman but does it have a feminist message or anything particularly to say about the female experience? 

Not really maybe there is that line about ""black girl magic"" but other than that nothing in the movie seemed very offensive to the average male movie goer.

If you contrast that with Barbie that has a explicitly feminist message and said the word ""patriarchy"" which obviously should turn off antifeminist viewers despite all that it was a success.

Now I see disney hiring a basically unknown female feminist female director to make a new star wars movie and I can't help but think they are trying to copy barbies success. Who knows maybe it will fail but I don't think disney is going to blame female leads or minorites for its failures. We are going to see a lot of barbie copy cats in the next few years like it or not.",225,0.72,2024-01-08 23:20:30,314

* Air couldn't get SAG Ensemble, missed Picture at the CC, didn't get longlisted at the BAFTA's aside from Screenplay, and I don't think there's enough passion for the movie.
* The Color Purple missed Globes, missed AFI, missed NBR, and is missing a lot of guilds.
* The Iron Claw missed SAG Ensemble, got no nominations at the Globes and CC, and got no mentions on the BAFTA longlist.
* The PGA's don't nominate foreign films unless they're win competitive for Best Picture, and Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest are not winning Best Picture, so I don't see them being nominated here.

&#x200B;

**Animated Motion Picture**

Elemental

Nimona

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

The Super Mario Bros. Movie

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

&#x200B;

So, in the nearly 20 years this category has existed, not one Studio Ghibli movie has been nominated here, so while I wouldn't give it 0%, I am not predicting The Boy and the Heron here. Meanwhile, this category has nominated an Illumination movie eight times (in 2010, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022). So with that in mind, I am going to predict the Mario movie. Aside from those:

* Wish I don't see happening here with the bad reviews and bad box office. I know it got GG and CC, but that was likely voted on by people who saw it before the reviews dropped, and I don't see the populist PGA nominating it.
* Chicken Run 2 is underseen and is not getting any major nominations so far, and while it could get BAFTA, I don't think it's enough to get in here.
* PGA doesn't nominate foreign films in this category, so I don't see Suzume, Robot Dreams, or The Peasants getting in.

Of course, the PGA's could throw us for a loop with the actual nominations, but for now this is what I think will happen.",4,0.83,2024-01-11 15:47:18,3

Hi GWA!

For a while now I've wanted to explore some other semi niche tags I had never really heard of or thought a lot about before joining the GWA subreddit--and dollification was a pretty fun scenario that I would come back to more than once after watching the Barbie movie.

It also gave me an opportunity to do some possessive personal attention dialogue by a yandere character fussing over your grooming and just, I really really wanted to do a wolf-in-sheeps clothing type character who the listener might have felt safe around at first.

Also because I couldn't resist ""She's Everything. He's Just Ken.""

Thanks very much to my bestie u/theycalledhimquiet for both writing the script for me and for listening to all my horrible gremlin thoughts I just DUMPED during brainstorming, haha.

"""Barbie"", 2023, Directed by Greta Gerwig, is a pretty terrible movie",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/18w0odd/barbie_2023_directed_by_greta_gerwig_is_a_pretty/,"Right off the bat, the production design, set design, costume design, and overall visual aspects of the movie are incredible. Those aspects of the film deserve to be rewarded and noticed for their brilliance. 

That said, the story of ""Barbie"" as executed by Gerwig and Baumbach, presents itself as a way too on the nose message with hardly any sub-text. On top of this, it is one of the more egregious executions of terrible script writing (dialogue) I can remember from a highly touted/box office leader flick. The script is full of matrix-level exposition, with less nuanced writing, and a more crystal clear message. 

I will even go a step further and call out the direct references to other key movies in cinema history (the opening sequence calling to 2001, the matrix callouts, the wizard of oz, the godfather, etc.) as being somewhat too obvious to the point of eye rolls. 

I really wanted to like this movie. I did. I really went into it with an open mind wanting to be taken by it. But the execution of filmmaking is objectively bad. 

Please note: I am not commenting on the themes of the movie, being matriarchy vs. patriarchy, expectations vs. reality, men vs. women, gender roles, etc. I am commenting on the actual execution of the flick via the script, the dialogue, and the directing.   ",115,0.71,2024-01-01 16:48:08,107

Mean Girls' To Be the First 'Grool' Opening of the Year As 'The Beekeeper' is the Buzzy Newcomer - Ticket Sales Tracking (1/8-1/11),https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/194n1kx/mean_girls_to_be_the_first_grool_opening_of_the/,"Hi,

I've been tracking ticket sales for movies recently at my two local NJ AMCs that do fairly well.

To kick off the new year, last week, Blumhouse's **Night Swim** was able to tread a bit better than expected.  For a victory lap both my **$.96M** Thurs and **$2.56M** Fri came in under actuals.  This paved way for a **$3.52M** Thurs+Fri estimate a healthy amount below actuals.  This is no gangbusters of an opening, but against a **$15M** budget, Blumhouse should take the small win, even if the legs plummet off a waterfall.

For the first holiday weekend of 2024, studios are trying to breakout their counter-programming for MLK day.  Coming off the heels of *two!!* holiday musicals, **Mean Girls** is coming to theaters to sing to a new generation.  That's right, we're not getting just a Mean Girls remake, but an adaptation of a Broadway musical.  Despite what the marketing may seem, yep, it's a musical.  Originally for streaming, Paramount decided to upgrade this release due to great test scores, a hot IP, and the fact that the strikes have led this Q1 to be pretty barren.  As long as no musical-negative WOM hits the unknowing audience, this can have a pretty healthy run.  Following in the footsteps of a fellow female skewer IP romp, we will use **Barbie** as a comp.  While the teens are occupied, the dads can hold themselves over next door at **The Beekeeper.**  Targeting older dudes and Jason Statham fanatics, this original romp is hoping to breakout amongst an arguably silly premise and non-stop football all weekend.  But hey, we can't knock down originality.  As a fellow star-driven action title, we will use **John Wick Chapter 4** as a comp.   I have recorded ticket sales for this Thursday and Friday for 3 Days. The green bars are how much ticket sales increased from day to day.

https://preview.redd.it/155e1v4i0ybc1.png?width=2348&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45a5f8b8efe7ff6773f43041cf1ef8160b1d246

Feeling like a godsend for Paramount, their streaming turned theatrical title is showing up to be a mini-breakout beast.  Over the week, ticket sales have had good growth, but nothing exploding.  As these patterns are more akin to fan-driven titles, the question is how front-loaded could this be.  Currently, MG is pacing towards a **$2.34M** Thursday compared to Barbie.  **Things to Note:** MG had early Dolby previews on Wednesday that will be added in later.  For a school-day in January, what a healthy start.  Clearly, things are not slowing down just yet as Friday is looking at **$11.34M** compared to Barbie.  To no real surprise, as an IP with a deep fanbase, there is a strong demand for this title with such capacities at both locations.  Of course, it is no match to Barbie, but with such already healthy capacities, it will be important to see how much growth the musical can still have on its final day.  Whoever decided to send MG theatrical instead of getting wasted away on the streaming void of Paramount+ needs a raise.

As ludicrous as its title may sound, The Beekeeper is looking to harvest up just the right audience.  Following in the footsteps of fellow original action titles, TB had extremely strong ticket sale growth throughout the week, especially at Theater 1.  No real surprise given the history of the genre.  At this rate, TB is looking to pollinate a **$1.70M** Thursday compared to JWC4.  **Things to Note:** TB had early Dolby previews that will be added in later.  Leave it to January to have a pulpy action title break out.  Things are looking just as healthy on Friday with **$3.60M** compared to JWC4.  Looks like audiences are catching the buzz on this one.  Given its small seat count, it is no surprise that the theater capacity is higher at Theater 2 (the smaller location) both days.  Also as expected, JWC4 is far succeeding TB on both days at both locations.  To be fair, that is the *fourth* entry to a franchise compared to this original feature.  Still, TB is following perfectly in line with other new action romps, so Statham is continuing to prove to be the ideal mid-budget marque action name.

Overall, this leads Mean Girls at an opening W+Th+F of **$14.43M**.  For The Beekeeper, we are looking at an opening Pre+Th+F of **$5.80M.**  If these numbers hold though, Mean Girls will have a grool **$36M** 3-day weekend while The Beekeeper will have a sweet as honey **$13M** opening.  Thankfully, Paramount budgeted these plastics well with **$36M**, so they should have no issue making a nice buck.  While we don't know the pricetag for The Beekeeper, we can hopefully assume that it looks small enough to eventually land in the green.  With no big studio titles for 2 weeks, let's hope these titles can last us awhile until our next big outing Feb. 2 with **Argylle**.

I have taken some suggestions to help make this post better. Please comment if you have anymore!

TL;DR:

**Mean Girls:**

Wed: **$.75M**

Thursday: **$2.34M**

Friday: **$11.34M**

Opening Day: **$14.43M**

&#x200B;

**The Beekeeper:**

Pre: **$.5M**

Thursday: **$1.70M**

Friday: **$3.60M**

Opening Day: **$5.80M**",17,0.84,2024-01-12 5:13:19,12

porn tells us about Satan's plot - the spiritual damage of pornography that no one talks about,https://www.reddit.com/r/antisex/comments/195zt6t/porn_tells_us_about_satans_plot_the_spiritual/,"i reckon it's not an antiporn subreddit, but plz keep reading, those are the aspects of antiporn that haven't been discussed before.

1) Satan hates women  
this is why entertainment and porn is replete with degrading images of them. No one is respected in porn, but even less so women.  
Studies have shown we're trained to look at women as disjointed body parts, because of how they're portrayed and represented in movies and TV, this gets amplified in porn, where we often don't even see their faces and where there's a bunch of close-ups on their genitals and breasts.

2) porn is actually the portrayal of the depravities the elite engage in   
If you know anything about the NWO and secret societies, then you know those people are in charge of what we consume through television and through our screens. And who are these non-human entities's ruler ? You guessed it, Satan. 

3) a lot of porn is sex trafficking, some of it is revenge porn, and a good chunk is also cgi  
With our modern day technology, it's possible to create porn that's entirely computer generated. Those people aren't even real sometimes, they hire a look-alike for public appearances. And if it's a real person, you can bet they'll never let them leave the porn industry. Hence why many end up commiting suicide, because they're trapped.

4) The women look like they're in pain or like they're about to cry  
As above so bellow. Satan's primary drive is to turn everything upside down, [pain](https://youtu.be/ayVuQLT00v0?t=25) becomes pleasure and pleasure becomes pain. Some people already have a hard time with reading facial expression. But porn rewires their brain even more to believe the woman who looks uncomfortable on screen actually enjoys it. It fucks up their neural pathways even further.

5) if the entertainment industry shows up through subliminal messages that celebrities are sex slaves to their Elite masters, porn shows what happens behind the scenes  
Those people who try to get into Hollywood are used as payment and get sold to the highest bidder. You sign up a contract, you give up rights to your body and your soul (both are intrinsically tied). That's why we find titles like *Naked Hollywood*, you mean Hollywood without the glitters and everything meant to deceive us into thinking it's a glamourous life.   
Many porn movies start with the premise of a young girl going to LA (city of the fallen angels). They tell the story of a real person who really tried to make it into Hollywood. It's also call ""wood"" because it's yes... it's a dirty wordplay. 

6) The fallen angels love to make dirty jokes everywhere and sexualize everything  
A belgian comedian for example had a show called [Glory Hallelujah](https://cdn-s-www.estrepublicain.fr/images/ef9fbab6-c64f-4556-a2e3-35c6ccd2aa38/BES_06/illustration-laura-laune-glory-alleluia_1-1670851484.jpg), referring to a porn category. they love using religion, in this case hallelujah, and perverting it, turning it into something dirty. The average person's brain is now so pornified, that they also think this way, and turn everything into a porn category. Even if our lizard brain is prone to do that, that's a tendency we should try to suppress rather than encourage.

7) creates unrealistic expectations and ruins women's self-image  
i don't care what anyone says about this, the look that's seen as trendy nowadays make women look like [pornified barbie dolls](https://www.realityrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Claudia-Walsh-had-her-lip-filled-in-2019.jpg).  
The huge fake boobs, and now the lip enhancements, just doesn't look at al natural, and yet it's so common place, especially on social media. If you want to be tiktok famous it's almost mandatory to have those.

8) porn desensitizes people  
Before you know we're gonna walk around being all zombies who have become unresponsive because we've been numbed down and dumbed down by the constant stimulants on our screen, phones, etc... Notice how people can't seat still and always need to look at their phones in public transport ? We spend less and less time reflecting and with our own thoughts, and people who consume porn don't have time to process what they just saw before they move on to an another (stronger) stimuli. 

9) Porn makes us spiritually weak   
We can't practice patience and delayed gratification because we want immediate gains. The things in  my life that were the most fullfilling required a lot of patience and perseverance. At the end you're like ""this is what makes life worth living, those moments where you're enjoying the fruit of your hard work."" So a society that has its brain on porn will give up at any difficulty, want everything handed out to them, as a result won't seek for answers other than the script that is given to us by the Hell-ite, easily manipulable and easy to lead on, like sheeps.

10) before internet porn there were books like ""Story of O""  
This book is said to be written by a woman, so that people can claim it's a deep feminist commentary on gender and giving up their agency for so called ""love"". But it's really an immersive look onto what it's like to be a sex slave for the elite and suffering from stockholm syndrom.  
*René wants O to learn to serve someone whom she does not love, and someone who does not love her. Over the course of this training, O falls in love with Sir Stephen and believes him to be in love with her as well. During the summer, Sir Stephen sends O to an old mansion in Samois solely inhabited by women for advanced training and body modifications related to submission.*",5,0.7,2024-01-13 22:18:01,5

FA chased me off the plane to give me an amenity kit as I was leaving 🥺,https://i.redd.it/i1um3j98utbc1.jpeg,"I flew a redeye JFK-AMS in economy this Tuesday-Wednesday. In New York I'd already noticed the FAs seemed in good spirits during boarding, they were all smiles and jokes. I require disability assistance and after boarding one of them came to my seat to ask me about my vision (I mentioned in the online form that I am slightly visually impaired, that note was meant for the assistance personnel on the ground because I have a hard time navigating/reading signs in the distance sometimes, reading instructions off of signs in the distance etc.) She asked me if I would be alright on my flight, if I could read the safety instructions on the IFE screen etc. Thought it was great they'd check with a pax personally to make sure they're safe! :)

As I was deboarding and asking them if assistance staff were ready for me, they were asking how my flight was, if I'd watched a movie; ended up having a little chat about Barbie and telling them I thought we had a great landing. (The landing on my outbound journey to JFK was pretty turbulent and gave me a little medical episode, so I was relieved with our smooth landing this week.) They seemed to really enjoy the fact that I commented on the landing 🥲 As I was walking out to the assistance staff, one of the FAs chased after me, handed me an amenity kit and said ""I have this for you!"" 

I was so pleasantly surprised. The staff seemed so helpful, sweet and involved the entire flight, and this was the cherry on top for me. No idea what made her feel so inclined to give it to me, but little gestures like these make me so happy and I was actually secretly hoping my dad would go on a business trip this year so he could give me one (this year's design is so cute!) Hope she knows it was much appreciated! 🥰",97,0.97,2024-01-11 15:10:26,6

Is the Best Picture ten locked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/193cjps/is_the_best_picture_ten_locked/,"This will probably be downvoted to oblivion, but unless something happens at PGA I truly believe we have a locked ten of Oppenheimer, The Holdovers, Poor Things, KOTFM, Barbie, American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, Maestro, Past Lives, and The Zone of Interest. While usually I would be worried about one of the movies in my ten, I think this is safe because I don't buy the other competitors.

* May December underperformed at the BAFTA longlist and SAG nominations, and it's other nominations outside of Screenplay are pretty shaky.
* Saltburn didn't get SAG Ensemble, and it's only other chance is PGA, which isn't enough on it's own.
* The Color Purple missed Globes, BAFTA longlists, and a lot of guilds. While it did get SAG Ensemble, one always misses Best Picture, and the Color Purple has a much weaker nom combo than the other four nominees, with it being possible that it gets Brooks and nothing else.
* Spider-Verse couldn't even win the Globe for Best Animated, and if it doesn't get PGA, not happening.
* All of Us Strangers has no nom combo with Barbie going Adapted, as it's only other shot is Best Actor, and I don't think that alone is enough for a nomination.
* Air missed SAG Ensemble and Viola Davis missed SAG Supporting Actress, making Screenplay it's only chance at a nom.
* The Iron Claw couldn't get SAG Ensemble or SAG Actor, so it's lone Screenplay or bust.
* The Boy and the Heron did win GG Animated over Spider-Verse, and it could get Score, but unless it gets a miraculous PGA nomination I don't see it happening.

Hi,

I've been tracking ticket sales for movies recently at my two local NJ AMCs that do fairly well.

To kick off the new year, last week, Blumhouse's **Night Swim** was able to tread a bit better than expected. For a victory lap both my **$.96M** Thurs and **$2.56M** Fri came in under actuals. This paved way for a **$3.52M** Thurs+Fri estimate a healthy amount below actuals. This is no gangbusters of an opening, but against a **$15M** budget, Blumhouse should take the small win, even if the legs plummet off a waterfall.

For the first holiday weekend of 2024, studios are trying to breakout their counter-programming for MLK day. Coming off the heels of *two!!* holiday musicals, **Mean Girls** is coming to theaters to sing to a new generation. That's right, we're not getting just a Mean Girls remake, but an adaptation of a Broadway musical. Despite what the marketing may seem, yep, it's a musical. Originally for streaming, Paramount decided to upgrade this release due to great test scores, a hot IP, and the fact that the strikes have led this Q1 to be pretty barren. As long as no musical-negative WOM hits the unknowing audience, this can have a pretty healthy run. Following in the footsteps of a fellow female skewer IP romp, we will use **Barbie** as a comp. While the teens are occupied, the dads can hold themselves over next door at **The Beekeeper.** Targeting older dudes and Jason Statham fanatics, this original romp is hoping to breakout amongst an arguably silly premise and non-stop football all weekend. But hey, we can't knock down originality. As a fellow star-driven action title, we will use **John Wick Chapter 4** as a comp. I have recorded ticket sales for this Thursday and Friday for 3 Days. The green bars are how much ticket sales increased from day to day.",2,1,2024-01-12 13:16:28,0

"If you could pick one movie for Rifftrax to VOD, what would you pick?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rifftrax/comments/1933v76/if_you_could_pick_one_movie_for_rifftrax_to_vod/,"Now, to preface, I said VOD, so let's be realistic. They're not gonna get to release a VOD riff of a New Hope   or say, The Barbie movie. The licensing costs wouldn't be worth what they'd get back in sales.

I'm interested to hear basically, what kind of obscure movie you'd love to see the guys riff on. And most of the obscure movies on Rifftrax are VODs. The ""Just the Jokes"" are mainly for well known films that would be too expensive too license (with a couple of exceptions, of course)

For me, if I could have my way, I would love them to riff  ""Flight of Dragons"" (1982) by Rankin Bass, a film that's not really based on anything. It takes it's ""scientific approach"" to Dragons from the book ""The Flight of Dragons"" and it lifts it's premise from ""The Dragon and the George"", but the story of the film itself is really it's own thing.

This film was Rankin Bass' attempt to recapture that magic they had with their adaptation of ""The Hobbit"" (and to a lesser extent, ""The Return of the King"") but the story wasn't anywhere near as compelling. It's also one of the films to mark the begin of the decline of Rankin Bass, but in a weird way, I kinda love the movie. In typical Rankin Bass fashion of the time, they cast recognizable actors from the time ( John Ritter, Harry Morgan, Victor Buono, James Earl Jones) 

I know the guys don't often like to do animated films, but this would be my holy grail for a Rifftrax VOD",12,0.88,2024-01-10 8:51:12,57

AITA for fighting with my best friend about her boyfriend because our friendship is being destroyed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1946rwm/aita_for_fighting_with_my_best_friend_about_her/,"**I do not give consent for this post to be shared on other platforms.**

Best friend of 3 years, living together for over 1. Since she met her boyfriend 10 months ago, our friendship has become strained. Most of our fights revolve around him.

Early on, she broke our promise to watch Barbie together by watching it with her bf = weekend of intense fighting. **Edit:** Her promise to watch the Barbie movie with me was also her apology and proving to me that she would stop flaking on me, which she had been doing frequently for the previous few months. She told me she wanted to and would watch it with me first, and that ""if"" she would watch it with her bf, the rewatching would be done with him. She initiated this conversation. When she broke that promise, which held more weight now, I was upset.

I suggested potentially living apart for a healthier dynamic, as then we'd both need to make an effort to see each other.

We reconciled but later her bf blocked and unblocked me on Insta. She believed his denial **Edit:** and blamed me, telling her that I must have blocked him.

Recently, I saw him on Hinge, which he denied too. She thinks someone else made it, initially suspecting me. After reflection, she didn't want to dwell on it, believing it wasn't him or me.

I purposely scheduled my flight for Friday last week to come to the city after we had discussed hanging over the weekend before she started her new job, not making concrete plans. Early last week, she explained she committed to spending the entire weekend at her boyfriend's place — ""staycation"", as part of his xmas gift for her. This was after we discussed hanging out.

She suggested hanging out on Monday instead. I decided not to reschedule. I believe that by consistently accommodating alternative times, I reinforce a pattern where she pushes our plans to the side when convenient for her, without facing consequences.

I've been distant since, feeling unappreciated in our friendship. Last night, we intensely argued about all of the above, and I expressed feeling unheard and seeing our friendship decline. Regrettably, I mentioned doubting her boyfriend's honesty in past situations.

Although she claims to believe both of us, I pointed out the contradiction believing she is saying what she thinks I want to hear to avoid conflict (she has avoidant attachment style).

I don't see how she would still be dating him if she thinks he's lying. Imo she believes her boyfriend but tells me she believes me / “both of us”. I conveyed my feeling that she doesn’t trust me because of this.

She denied being manipulated by him and almost ended the conversation, asserting she won't hear such accusations. I apologized. She wants to move on without further discussing these specific instances, and said that these fights are not normal in friendships (which I agree with). She has admitted that her boyfriend told her I am “creating drama”.

My friend says I am the asshole for making her choose between them and bringing up these situations, but I think it isn't about choosing between us, it is about believing the truth. I am not naive enough to think that she would pick me over her boyfriend.

I think my concerns are justified and my friend is in denial about the influence all of this has on our friendship. But, I think I might be the asshole as my friend is obviously very affected by this and I do push her too much in these situations; I feel frustrated that she usually sees the situation clearly but after speaking to her boyfriend, believes whatever he tells her.

This is your reminder to watch Barbie especially if you didn't catch it in the cinema,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/comments/1928u7z/this_is_your_reminder_to_watch_barbie_especially/,"Barbie is one of those movies that kinda flew under the radar, while still very much not flying under the radar if that makes sense.

Every major YouTube reviewer talked about it, most people had at least heard about it, it made descent money, but man, it's too good compared how little a dent it made in Pop culture.

Most people I know haven't seen it. And finding one who has is like finding your best friend at an event you didn't know both of you were going to.

It's a colorful, fun, emotional, and fast ride through barbieland. Excellently shot. With an insanely good cast, and some pretty good pondering on the nature of unknowable forces such as luck and fate.

A mystery that just keeps going, and plot that never stops and characters that live rent free in my mind and heart.

If you like style AND substance. Barbie is for you.",33,0.83,2024-01-09 7:09:53,6

Just watched Society of the Snow,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1913t43/just_watched_society_of_the_snow/,"What a powerful movie. One of my favorite movies of the year. After watching it I seriously hope the Academy gives it some love. Its now my choice to win Makeup/Hairstyle. The job those artists had simulating the different stages of skin deteriorating with the cold temperatures is just fantastic, just like the wounds in their skin. But I would also include it in the adapted screenplay category in front of Barbie. For me its WAY more deserving. I dont think its going to happen cause its an extremely packed category already with Oppenheimer, KOTFM, Poor Things and American Fiction pretty much locked, and movies like The Zone of Interest, Barbie, The Color Purple, Across the Spider-Verse will probably have better chances in getting the nomination, but it would make me extremely happy if this movie got an adapted screenplay nomination. Do you guys think it might win any Oscars, like for example best foreign festure film, or is Past Lives locked to win that one?

SAG+DGA Predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/192vi6p/sagdga_predictions/,"I kinda tanked with these last year so we’ll see if that was a fluke or if I’m trash with SAG

&#x200B;

**Best Ensemble**

1. Oppenheimer
2. Barbie
3. Killers of the Flower Moon
4. American Fiction
5. Saltburn

Alternate: The Colour Purple

I looked through SAG Ensemble history and the only film to hit one other guild and still make SAG Ensemble was Bombshell and The Butler with MU&H, but those won their categories there whereas Colour Purple is almost definitely not. Which may seem arbitrary but I think it says something about whether your movie is connecting with the industry as a whole or not. Not to mention that, as sometimes happens with late releases, screening issues could have hindered its visibility.

With that said I don’t actually think Amazon’s getting 2 Ensemble noms and am half-expecting Colour Purple or Poor Things to show up. But I can’t decide whether Saltburn—buzzy around voting time, fits the profile of a House of Gucci/Babylon nominee, doing really well with guilds, several showy performances—or American Fiction—TIFF winner, topical crowdpleaser, likely BP nominee, apparently many fun performances—is more likely, so I’m going with both and just accepting that I won’t get above a 4/5. I can also see arguments for Holdovers, Air, and The Iron Claw getting nominated here but they’re a tier below the films I’ve already mentioned.

&#x200B;

**Best Actor**

1. Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer
2. Bradley Cooper, Maestro
3. Paul Giamatti, The Holdovers
4. Jeffrey Wright, American Fiction
5. Leonardo DiCaprio, Killers of the Flower Moon

Alternate: Colman Domingo, Rustin

This seems like a really solid five but Domingo also feels like SAG bait. I do mention Netflix bias but they don’t get literally all of their noms in every year, plus the movie is beyond buzzless.

&#x200B;

**Best Actress**

1. Lily Gladstone, Killers of the Flower Moon
2. Emma Stone, Poor Things
3. Margot Robbie, Barbie
4. Carey Mulligan, Maestro
5. Natalie Portman, May December

Alternate: Greta Lee, Past Lives

Maybe I’m delusional but hear me out: May December is getting a big push from Netflix, a group that’s (1) very solid at campaigning noms, and (2) an organization that SAG famously is biased towards. Portman gives easily the baitiest performance in May December and is literally playing an actor and has a whole monologue about the acting process. Even though she’s obviously a bit of a bold prediction I’m honestly surprised more people aren’t going for her.

&#x200B;

**Best Supporting Actor**

1. Ryan Gosling—Barbie
2. Robert Downey Jr.—Oppenheimer
3. Charles Melton—May December
4. Robert De Niro—Killers of the Flower Moon
5. Dominic Sessa—The Holdovers

Alternate: Mark Ruffalo—Poor Things

Screw it, predicting a surprise nom for Sessa. Initially I was going to just go with the consensus 5 but Sessa makes so much sense as a baity role with lots of screen time and being a young, breakout actor, which SAG loves. Plus we’re bound to have one performance that makes it here but was snubbed at GG and CC and he’s the most likely candidate. 

Predicting Ruffalo to be a random miss since he was snubbed for Spotlight and his character’s very comedic but also slimy, unlike De Niro who’s chilling in his villainy. I do think any of the bottom three are snubbable, De Niro for not being that flashy, Melton for being relatively subtle but also not well-established and in a weaker vehicle than Sessa. I do have a weird feeling that Melton could miss even with Moore/Portman in but it's kinda baseless so don't quote me on that. ~~I swear to god I was sceptical of Ruffalo here even before today and am not just copying Clayton Davis~~

This was a last minute change that I will probably regret but oh well, might as well take more risks, right?

&#x200B;

**Best Supporting Actress**

1. Da’Vine Joy Randolph, The Holdovers
2. Emily Blunt, Oppenheimer
3. Jodie Foster, Nyad
4. Julianne Moore, May December
5. American Ferrera, Barbie

Alternate: Danielle Brooks, The Colour Purple

For the record I would be surprised if Brooks was actually snubbed but I don’t know which of the last three above she’d replace. Foster has a very showy and lengthy role from Netflix, Moore’s been showing up even when Melton and Portman are snubbed, and Ferrera just feels like a very buzzy coattail. Additionally, if Colour Purple misses Ensemble like it very well could, I don’t really see Brooks being strong enough to be the sole nom at the Oscars. At which point a miss here would make things more elegant.

&#x200B;

**DGA**

1. Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer
2. Martin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon
3. Greta Gerwig, Barbie
4. Yorgos Lanthimos, Poor Things
5. Alexander Payne, The Holdovers

Alternate: Bradley Cooper, Maestro

I might be making a mistake by leaving out Netflix, but with Randolph having her Oscar almost totally locked up I can’t help but think that Holdovers is cementing itself as a top 5 contender. I know he’s been missing a lot of places, but as shown with Kosinski last year, that doesn’t always matter if your film is strong enough. Plus, it has better reviews and audience scores than Maestro, which always helps.

Beyond Cooper, Song has an outside chance if the passion for Past Lives is strong enough, and Jefferson could shock because of the TIFF stat regarding DGA/Best Director at the Oscars (which is not something I put particular weight into but whatever). Fifth slot is pretty open here.",7,0.89,2024-01-10 1:09:30,3

Right wing views more than usual,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMorningToastSnark/comments/192x9ri/right_wing_views_more_than_usual/,"Long rant and my apologies. What the fuck are these girls doing?? Genuinely, do they have PR team??? I have questioned my own morals the last few days listening to both of them. 

To start, Jackie has such a chip on her shoulder. What is wrong in your life, girl? You have a billionaire husband, all the money and wealth and access to anything you want. Your job is to read books and snark on celebrities. Does she get that??
She is constantly nasty, too good for “poop humor”/tiktok and every time she brings up her husband and how she “pops in” while he’s watching tv. Like does she spend any time with her husband at all??? Seems like they live entirely separate lives. (Unrelated, but I just KNOW she SUCKS in bed.. sorry if that was too far but i can just tell) 
Her comments about the vaccine today and overall political remarks are never sourced with anything, and she clearly doesn’t do her research on anything. She’s so judgemental and close minded. You can tell how brutally insecure she is. I cannot stand her!!!!!

Now Claudia. I am so conflicted with her. I genuinely think she is talented, and can be extremely hilarious. But her views sometimes SHOCK me. What the fuck was her remark in the Golden Globes recap about how she hates women?? And she didn’t like the Barbie movie??? That movie was literally made for insecure girlies like the Oshry sisters. Claudia really couldn’t see the point of that movie at all??? Really???
Now looking past her right wing remarks, I really don’t understand her passionate love for Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift (in my opinion) stands for everything she does not. (I’m also not a Swiftie, but have no issue with Taylor Swift) lmk if I’m missing something because imo Taylor swift is the ultimate feminist. 
She also mentioned not less than a month ago about how IMPORTANT WOMEN ARE for streams, growth, fan base, etc. now all women just cancel and she hates them???

Now Ben. GOOD FUCKING GOD. I HAVE NEVER MET SOMEONE MORE UNLIKABLE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. 
He is such a little nat in his podcast with Josh Peck. Like so unfunny, never says anything of value, and will constantly say fucked up things and it’s actually entertaining to watch how Josh reacts. I give the Good Guys podcast maybe 1 more year before Josh’s PR team advises him to stay far away from him. Claudia’s remarks on today’s toast was very alarming in terms of her husbands remarks and how he doesn’t get cancelled— due to “more male viewers and males don’t cancel”….. uhm??? Can someone pull good guys stats… there is NO WAY straight men/men in general listen to that podcast more than women. I would be SHOCKED. 

I have a lot more to say but I’ll wrap it up with this. 

Jax&Claud pls just stick to the stories. Sure, briefly talk about Beef stew and remembering Theo but if you keep bringing up these bizzare conservative remarks you’re going to lose a lot of listeners. Be light, be funny, and leave the nefarious behavior to your mother.",166,0.9,2024-01-10 2:32:57,88

###**Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom**

Not quite hitting projections but still up +3% from yesterday and down just -10% from last week.

Projections for the next few days less optimistic though as its currently projected a $1.19M(-60%) 4th weekend.

Makes further gains vs Oppenheimer today but if the weekend projections come to pass its gonna find itself behind for the first time since day 11.

Annoying female characters who deserve better treatment from media and fandoms!,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/192zjvl,"As a fan of all types of media since I was a little girl, I have noticed that females that are slightly annoying are considered the worst by Media/Fandom. At the age of 10 I got into my first fandom with Avatar the Last Airbender where I dealt with seeing hate towards Katara, even though she was arguably one of the most well rounded characters in the show other than Zuko and Azula. As a child all I had was escapism with media due to childhood trauma, so seeing characters that weren’t the cookie cutter happy all the time characters helped me personally. I related to the a type characters or hurt characters cause I was one. When I started to get in media analysis I realized characters like this are almost always hated even when they weren’t the worst person on the show. Men in media can get away with being legit psychopaths but god forbid a female gets upset about their lives, trauma and/or make mistakes. Female characters shouldn’t have to be a one size fits all character, there should be characters that are allowed to show emotion, be ambitious, cunning, and even mean because it shows the human side of them. Misogyny is still rampant in fandoms to this day and Will probably sadly never go away. While the Barbie movie was very kids first feminist class I think the speech made ironically by America who played Amy for it kind of symbolizes female characters and real life females like this. 
So this is an appreciation post to the misunderstood girls of media who deserve better.",41,0.7,2024-01-10 4:29:21,101

An overlooked lesson of Barbenheimer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/190cj7v/an_overlooked_lesson_of_barbenheimer/,"Fewer people are going to the movies. Movie tickets and concessions are more expensive these days (except for people with movie passes/subscriptions), and the rise of the internet and streaming mean that there are a lot of cheaper options for entertainment these days. 

Given those things, I wonder part of the reason for the huge success of Barbie and Oppenheimer is that they both appealed to people in the professional middle-class, ie people with money to spend on going to the movies. They are about other things too, but Barbie is about the struggles of professional women to be taken seriously and get ahead in the world, and Oppenheimer is about the struggle between professionals who actually care about the consequences of their work and those playing petty status games.

Films have traditionally been divided into stuff for the masses, and high-art for the Oscars and stuff, but I wonder if the changing economics of going to the movies means that the sweet spot is now in the middle. Upper-middle class professionals are not auteurs who care about the high art of cinema, but they don't want mindless junk either. They want stuff that feels relevant to them and looks good on IMAX, and Barbie and Oppenheimer succeeded because they delivered on that.

Repost:
I’m looking for someone who’s willing to watch movies or just enjoy music with me irl over beer/coffee. Preferably someone na malapit lang para mas madaling matuloy or maaya. Pass sa sobrang north or south, sorry. I can host (but I don’t own a hugeass smart TV na 4k plus medyo mahirap lang parking dito) but if you can host too, that’ll be great as well. I can bring food naman. Mandaluyong/Makati/Kapitolyo area

SFW initially but I’m hoping open ka sa NSFW if we vibe in the long run. Not seriously looking to date, yet.

My mainstream film takes/preferences just to give you an idea:

- Little Women > Ladybird > Barbie
- I would probably try to reference Mean Girls every time I get
- I’ve never seen Shawshank in maybe 20+ years
- There was a time I was so into mumblecore
- I’ve seen all Wes Anderson full feature films except Bottle Rocket and Aquatic Life
- I’ve seen all MCU films up until GOTG 3
- Prisoner of Azkaban >>> every other HP film
- some relatively popular directors I admire include: Gerwig and Wes obvs, Nolan, Linklater, Peele, Bong Joon-Ho, Trier, WKW, Cuaron, Woody Allen (when he was still a decent human being), Villeneuve (haven’t seen Dune) and maybe Scorsese. I enjoyed Tarantino’s filmography too but I have mixed feelings because of his “kinks” lol

Music I listen to:

- some 90s grunge and late 90s nu metal
- 2000s emo and post-hardcore
- a ton of metalcore. A TON.
- 2010s djent
- We all know that I’m not quite her target audience but I can honestly say that as a guy, I’m more than average as a Swiftie
- SZA’s Ctrl is prolly my go-to RNB album
- My top 5 rappers include: Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Andre 3000, Jay Z and Tupac
- PS: I try to go to local gigs every now and then. I used to enjoy moshpits to boot.

More about me:

- 5’10
- single for a yr now
- child-free
- decent-looking and looks way younger than my age
- thick brows (lol)
- fair complexion
- slim but about to re-enter his fitness journey
- quintessential Millennial tito but can relate to most Gen Z kids
- catdad
- inked
- hoops nerd
- Kakampink
- progressive mostly
- working professional, relatively decent earner but not overly successful (yet)
- respects boundaries
- INTP if it matters
- not a licensed pro but has an idea or two about the concept of healing from one’s childhood trauma and coping with failed romantic relationships

Hopefully you/you’re:

- 23-38
- working professional
- hopefully not below 5 ft kasi I’m tall based on Pinoy standards. Mej awkward lang for me sorry
- body type doesn’t really matter basta you’re someone who dresses well and is confident with how you look
- articulate/well-read
- non-DDS/apolo10
- don’t ghost, if you don’t feel like talking just lmk and I’ll do the same. If I don’t reply after 24-48 hours my lines are still open (baka busy lang kakalaro ng PS5) so feel free to still talk to me

Please read carefully and send a decent, well-written intro para naman less questions haha.

As a qualifier, drop some of your fave films/music artists. Hi/hellos will not be entertained.

We can move to Telegram if you’re down to swap pics :)",2,1,2024-01-12 11:13:03,0

* Oppenheimer and Succession have been named the top winners of the Golden Globes.
* Barbie made over $1.4 billion in global sales, therefore there could only be one [winner](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/fideum-group-is-the-mastercard-lighthouse-finitiv-program-winner/).
* Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for best supporting actor for Oppenheimer.

Oppenheimer and Succession have been named the top winners of the Golden Globes, while Barbie’s supremacy at the box [office](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/box-office-collection-of-the-movies-fukrey-3-and-skanda/) has also been praised.

The road rage thriller Beef and the fast-paced kitchen drama The Bear won big in the TV categories, while Emma Stone’s Poor Things, Paul Giamatti’s The Holdovers, and the French thriller Anatomy Of A Fall did well in the cinema categories.

# The 2024 Golden Globes

Barbie made over $1.4 [billion](https://worldmagzine.com/food/india-announced-141-billion-to-free-food-grains-program/) in global sales when the inaugural prize for cinematic accomplishment was given, therefore there could only be one winner.

Gong dedication: Margot Robbie, clad in Barbie pink, dedicated the gong to “every single person on the planet who dressed up and went to the greatest place on earth — the movie theaters.”

Christopher Nolan won best director, Cillian Murphy won best actor, and Oppenheimer took home five [awards](https://worldmagzine.com/fashion/at-the-british-fashion-awards-celebrities-flaunt-their-sense-of-style/). Three acting trophies were given to Sarah Snook, Matthew Macfadyen, and Keiran Culkin for Succession, which won four gongs.

A grateful Murphy thanked his fellow candidates and co-stars as he won his medal for his portrayal of J Robert Oppenheimer. In addition to Nolan’s first victory as best director following six nominations, Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for best-supporting actor for Oppenheimer.

Community Survey Results - Best of 2023 and Most Anticipated of 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/193clrl/community_survey_results_best_of_2023_and_most/,"Hello all! I'm here with the results of the survey I sent out last week asking for people's best films of 2023 and the most anticipated films of 2024! In total we had 76 people (including myself) respond, which is an increase from when I put this survey out last year and got 30 total. 33% were part of the AODR Discord, 43% are in this subreddit, and 30% are in /r/oscarsdeathrace. And only 3 people total listen to my podcast T_T.

---

**Top Films of 2023 (Specifically Indicated)**

I specifically asked people to put their top film overall in the first response. We got 26 individual films in the responses. 

1. Oppenheimer - 16 
2. Past Lives - 7 
3. Poor Things / Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse - 6
4. Anatomy of a Fall / Barbie / May December- 4 
5. All of Us Strangers / Killers of the Flower Moon / Holdovers - 3
6. Asteroid City / John Wick 4 / Red White and Royal Blue - 2

Films with 1 response each included: A Thousand and One / Balckberry / Bottoms / Fallen Leaes / Hitman / Maestro / Monster / Nimona / Perfect Days / Skinamarink / Still: A Michael J Fox Movie / The Boy and the Heron / Zone of Interest

Notably, Best Picture contender American Fiction got 0 endorsements as the top film of the year (Maestro and Zone of Interest each got at least 1)

I also did this survey last year with 30 people as I mentioned, and here were the results for the specifically mentioned most anticipated film of 2023. 

1. Barbie (T-4th)
2. Dune 2 (got pushed)
3. Killers of the Flower Moon (t-5th)
4. Oppenheimer (got 1st) / Beau is Afraid (N/A)
5. Antman 3 / Bottoms (got 1 mention) / Indiana Jones 5 / Inside / It's Only Life After All / Magic Mike Last Dance / Nightbitch / Passages / The Color Purple

---

**Top Films of 2023 (Aggregated)**

For this section I am looking at how many times a film is mentioned across all top 10s regardless of if it was the most indicated or not. Here there were 129 unique films mentioned. Again these were out of 76 total responses - I'll cut off at 8 mentions, to indicate those that got at least 10% of the mentions

1. Oppenheimer - 54
2. Killers of the Flower Moon - 41
3. Holdovers - 39
4. Past Lives - 38
5. Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse - 37
6. May December - 36
7. Barbie - 33
8. Anatomy of a Fall - 30
9. Poor Things - 27
10. Bottoms - 19
11. The Boy and the Heron - 17
12. John Wick 4 - 16
13. Saltburn - 15
14. The Iron Claw / The Killer - 13
15. Godzilla Minus One - 12
16. Asteroid City / 17. Zone of Interest - 11
17. All of Us Strangers / Blackberry / Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 / Monster - 9
18. Maestro - 8

Below this, notably American Fiction only got on 4 people's list. Also, the people who mentioned A Thousand and One, Still, and Red White and Royal Blue as their top film of the year were the only people to mention these films at all among the 76. 

To compare to last year's most anticipated (aggregated)

1. Barbie (got 7th)
2. Spiderman Across the Spiderverse (got 5th)
3. Dune 2 (got pushed) / Oppenheimer (got 1st)
4. Mission Impossible 7 (got 4 total)
5. Killers of the Flower Moon (got 2nd)
6. The Boy and the Heron (got 11th)
7. Asteroid City (tied for 16th)
8. Beau is Afraid (got 6 total)
9. Wonka (got 7 total) / Cocaine Bear (got 1 total)

**Letterboxd Panel**

I asked people also if they would share their Letterboxd profiles with me so I could create an ""index"" of users from this community to see how the community rated films overall. For this exercise I started with the 12 or so films I think are in Best Picture consideration (plus Saltburn to see how divisive it really is). I included only profiles that had seen at least 6 of these films, and consistently rated their films (can't do an index without ratings), leaving me with an index of 41 profiles. Here are the results, with the averages, number of people who had seen the films, and standard deviation (closer to 0 is more consensus, closer to 1 is more divisive)

1. Oppenheimer - 4.43 (41 seen, 0.738 stdev) - fun fact, 19 people rated it a 5, the most of any film / score combo. (3 people rated it between 2.5 and 3.0)
2. Poor Things - 4.35 (26 seen, 0.689 stdev)
3. Anatomy of a Fall - 4.28 (36 seen, 0.469 stdev) - Nothing less than a 3.5
4. Zone of Interest - 4.23 (13 seen, 0.633 stdev)
5. Past Lives - 4.20 (40 seen, 0.758 stdev) - high stdev is due to one person rating it a 1 star and 1 person 3 stars. Everyone else was 3.5 or higher
6. All of Us Strangers - 4.18 (17 seen, 0.749 stdev)
7. Killers of the Flower Moon - 4.17 (39 seen, 0.517 stdev) - 18 people rated it a 4.0 flat, the most for this score. Nothing less than a 3
8. May December - 4.11 (40 seen, 0.554 stdev) - received the most ratings of 4.5 (15)
9. Holdovers - 4.11 (35 seen, 0.583 stdev)
10. Barbie - 4.00 (41 seen, 0.623 stdev)
11. American Fiction - 3.71 (19 seen, 0.451 stdev) - no one gave this 5 stars
12. Maestro - 3.47 (32 seen, 0.793 stdev) - only one person gave it 5 stars

And Saltburn was seen by 35 people, had an average rating of 3.46, with a whopping 0.973 standard deviation. 

Obviously, those that have yet to go wide (Zone of Interest, American Fiction, and All of Us Strangers) had fewer viewers. Meanwhile, literally everyone has seen Oppenheimer, May December and Barbie (and only one person missed Past Lives, and 2 on Killers of the Flower Moon)

Also among our panelists, 8 people have seen all 13 films I looked at (including myself), with an average of 10.12. The harshest rater gave an average score of 3.25, while the most generous had an average grade of 4.68 (overall average was 4.06)

**Most Anticipated of 2024 - Specific**

Out of 75 people, there were 27 films specifically mentioned as the most anticipated. 

1. Dune 2 - 23
2. Mickey 17 - 8
3. Furiosa - 5
4. Borderlands / Nosferatu - 4
5. Inside Out 2 - 3
6. Ballerina / Deadpool 3 / Joker 2 / Spiderman: Beyond the Spiderverse / Untitled Jordan Peele film / Wicked Part 1 - 2

There were 133 total films mentioned, though many of these were films that came out in 2023 that have yet to go wide / release in other regions. Below are the films with at least 15 mentions (ie at least 20% of the 75 respondents were looking forward to them

Tapos there is an ""iPhone face"" - they know what an iPhone is, yung tipong very 21st century ang mukha. their faces don't fit well sa mga period films or mga movies na set in the past. Mas bagay yung features nila on stories na set sa present period

Personally, eto akin:
Pre-colonial: Rochelle Pangilinan (she portrayed a pre-colonial royalty sa Amaya before), Bianca Umali, Elijah Canlas, Diana Zubiri, Angel Aquino, JC Santos, Jericho Rosales

Spanish period: Iza Calzado, Kristine Hermosa, Jasmine Curtis-Smith, Albert Martinez, Zaijan Jaranilla, Tirso Cruz III

Mga iPhone faces: Chie Filomeno, Barbie Forteza (her role in MCAI makes total sense), Sue Ramirez, Daniel Padilla, Mavy Legaspi, Donny Pangilinan",64,1,2024-01-09 3:02:16,27

we are both 18 and have a bit of an argumentative-in-a-fun-way dynamic with contrasting aesthetics a la sibling rivalry (but that name is evidently taken). we would probably focus on: drag race recap/review or other gay stuff/reality shows like jersey shore and project adventure, pop culture (movies, shows, kpop, other music etc), playing games like roblox or episode and trolling kids (video episodes prob), maybe some deep convos on occasion. we also might watch some old barbie movies and react to those bc they have some… interesting plot lines and things going on

I feel dead.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1944hpq/i_feel_dead/,"I’m fighting the urge to text him.
We were together 10 years. I shouldn’t be surprised by how he’s acting, I see now he monkey branched from his ex wife to me. 
So we were together since I was 19, he was 27. Got married 8 months prior to the separation. EIGHT MONTHS. The way it went down is he told me his daughter (11) didn’t like me. Which would be odd in itself because I’ve always been in her life, while we weren’t always on the same page, she and I had plans THAT WEEKEND to watch the Barbie movie and have a girls night. If she actually didn’t like me and if that was the case, then he should/would have let her and I figure it out and continue on. But instead he just wanted to separate. Well I thought it was weird, so I got into his phone records and it turns out he had been texting and spending HOURS on the phone with a mutual “friend” who literally helped me out of my wedding dress. When I confronted them both with the phone records, I guess that ended things because it got too messy probably for the girl. He admitted to me they made out, something she probably didn’t want him to divulge. When I got the phone records, that’s when I left the house and we legitimately separated. I took the day off and moved all my shit out. Unfortunately, I didn’t have far to go, because my parents live in the same neighborhood. Yep, that’s how we met.
So it’s been literally 3 weeks since I’ve been out. I did end up messaging him last week saying I was still open to reconciliation. He’s not. He never accepted accountability for cheating or anything, he just says he’s “choosing his daughter over me.”
Well, in the past 3 weeks, being in the same fucking neighborhood, I can’t help but notice he’s had someone over for the night and he’s spent a few nights not at home. Most recently, last night. I couldn’t take my dogs due to my current living circumstances so they’re still there. He got home from work yesterday, let them out, and then didn’t come back until this morning. Not only is it hurting me how quickly he has moved to the next female, he’s neglecting our dogs. 
I want to text him so badly. I want to tell him it’s bullshit that after 10 years he moved on so quickly. That he’s a liar. What was I to him? Why did we get married? How did we go from all that love, all that time, to nothing. To him being with someone else already. To him having someone in OUR bed while it was probably still warm from me still.
I know it’s useless. He would probably enjoy the fact that I still care and that I’m hurting. If I confirm to him I know, he might start flaunting it in my face. I just don’t know what to do.
I’m obviously looking at moving, but I can’t find anything right now. 

TLDR;
With this man for 10 years, married 8 months, separated for 3 weeks and he’s already with someone new. Staying the night there and leaving our dogs alone 12+ hours. Unfortunately live right next to him for now. Been NC for 5 days but really fighting the urge to text.",4,0.75,2024-01-11 15:36:10,5
"In 2023, the worldwide Box Office for Hollywood movies was significantly higher than in 2022. But if we only look at the Top-10 grossing movies, 2023’ top movies made much less than 2022’ top movies. What conclusions can be drawn from this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/191razf/in_2023_the_worldwide_box_office_for_hollywood/,"2022 Top-10 Worldwide Box Office:


1) Avatar: 2.32 bn 

2) Top Gun: 1.50 bn

3) Jurassic World: 1.00 bn

4) Dr Strange: 955 M

5) Minions: 940 M

6) Black Panther: 859 M

7) The Batman: 772 M

8) Thor: 761 M

9) Puss in Boots: 482 M

10) Fantastic Beasts: 407 M



2023 Top-10 Worldwide Box Office:


1) Barbie: 1.44 bn

2) Mario: 1.36 bn

3) Oppenheimer: 1 bn (with Japan)

4) GotG: 846 M

5) Fast X: 705 M

6) Spider Man: 691 M

7) Wonka: 600+ M

8) Little Mermaid: 570 M

9) Mission Impossible: 568 M

10) Elemental: 496 M


Added up, the Top-10 in 2022 was about 11 bn, in 2023 it was about 8.3 bn. If we only look Top-8, in 2022 it was about 10.1 bn, in 2023 about 7.2 bn. So in 2022, the Top-8 made about 40% more revenue than in 2023, for the Top-10, it was about 33% higher in 2022 than in 2023.

So what does this tell us? Is it coincedence? Is the overall Box Office only up in 2023 compared to 2022 because more movies came out (and not because people in general „are more likely to go to the movies again“)?

If we look towards 2024, that trend might continue by the way. I have a hard time believing that the 8th highest grossing movie in 2024 will be at 761 M, like Thor was in 2022. I also don’t think we will have one 2bn+ and three 1bn+ movies in 2024 like we had in 2022.

Female friendships,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/19156n0/female_friendships/,"I had a thought- why are there such few mainstream movies in Bollywood that focus on female friendships? Queen is a good one and I remember watching it and being blown away by how good it was- I watched it several times. I realise now that it’s one of the few movies where there’s a strong (and realistic) focus on female friendships. Other than that, I can think of: cocktail (but friendship was the subplot), YJHD (same), and Aisha (which is based on a western novel). 

Does it reflect Indian society’s lack of consideration for women and their inner lives and interests? A movie about women won’t do well commercially, I guess and will perhaps get judged more harshly (I haven’t seen veere di wedding but maybe that’s what happened there to an extent). 

Men get ZNMD, Kai po che, 3 idiots, dil chahta hai and countless more. I hope the female reboot of ZNMD goes ahead and is done well to show filmmakers that catering to a female audience is a worthwhile endeavour(what Barbie did for Hollywood!). I will also watch Dhak Dhak on Netflix - hope it scratches that itch I have to watch a good movie on female friendships!",128,0.85,2024-01-07 22:51:53,93

Centrist Drinker,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthankrayt/comments/192h1vv/centrist_drinker/,"Between this and the Panderverse review I get the feeling that he wants to be seen as a reasonable middleman between the crazy pro woke and anti woke people.

He correctly identified the context of Obaid-Chinoy's quote regarding the new Star Wars and said yeah men and women can both be capable of good and bad directing. Good on him i guess.

He conveniently seems to act as if he had no role in stoking the fires of this anti-woke discourse with his massively popular videos.

Not to mention he himself was quite willing to misrepresent films to shit on them like with Barbie, ATSV and Glass Onion.

In the panderverse review he talked about how that episode mocked fans who have a bizarre view of Kathleen Kennedy as some bizarre monster out to ruin everything when the truth is probably more mundane but I remeber him making shit up about KK trying to put women in SW as revenge for being forced to work as a secretary or something but I don't know which video it came from)

Also he still peddles the tired talking point of ""Disney ST is obsessed with identity"" even though the movies hardly seem to bring Rey's identity up (you know he had Rey in mind when writing that)
It's like Rey happens to be a woman and also happens to be not well written, fine but they've confused that with ""the movie isobsessed with identity, I am definitely not obsessed with wokeness""

He then talked about how the MCU is just hiring inexperienced women directors as token diversity hires and throwing them under the bus when the movies fail, citing the inexperience of: 

Nia Dacosta(who already had a couple of well received low budget movies under her belt)

 Chloe Zhao (who directed the very well-received Nomadland) 

Cate Shortland (who has a couple of decently reviewed movies under her belt). 

He notes they ultimately aren't cultivating actual talent. He has a point about inexperience but it applies to the male creators as well(Jeff Loveness had no feature film writing credits before Ant man 3, Michael Waldron wasn't a huge creative before MCU phase 4, even experienced creators like Sam Raimi got screwed due to mismanagement).

The problem goes beyond gender as Marvel wants inexperienced creators to control them easier. Literally this is how Marvel has mostly operated and it's not working anymore. 

(I sourced this stuff from a TVTropes article on MCU franchise original sin. I don't want HBomberguy to make a video on me. Link here
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FranchiseOriginalSin/MarvelCinematicUniverse)

Barbie Happy Family Collection Found,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barbie/comments/1913htv/barbie_happy_family_collection_found/,"A bit of a newcomer so I apologize if I break any rules.

TLDR: Keep or sell? Will this stay valuable or is it just a fad?

I wasn't much of a Barbie fan growing up but I still had some (was more of a Lego and Pokemom girl). Because of this I wasn't really aware that I had rare Barbie toys under my nose until I watched the Barbie movie and learned about Midge and how her pregnant version was discontinued, and that was the one I remember having as a kid. I mentioned it to some of my mom's friends at a New Years party and they said I should absolutely find them again. So that's exactly what I did today. As I did digging online I learned how the doll I thought was Ken all these years was actually *Allen* which I thought was cool to learn as well. And I had completely forgotten about the grandparent dolls as well, I've never seen them anywhere else! There are a few missing pieces, most of the cardboard is gone, and the dolls probably need their clothes washed and hair restyled but I was surprised I found almost all the accessories. I think my favorite is the wind up blender.

I'm on the fence with selling them and my mom says I should keep them because they might be worth more in the future. My question is will these be playsets that will retain their currently high value on the market as time goes on or is this more of a fad that may cool off in a year or two. I thought asking people who know much more about these dolls could help me quite a bit, thanks for your help!

Golden Globe winner predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/190jl3n/golden_globe_winner_predictions/,"Yes, hopping on the bandwagon to predict winners with everyone else. Because it’s the Globes and there’s always a chance for something crazy to happen, I’m ranking all the contenders in order of likelihood even though most of these are not win-competitive whatsoever. Also providing explanations for some of the trickier categories.

&#x200B;

**Best Motion Picture—Drama**

1. **Oppenheimer**
2. Killers of the Flower Moon
3. Anatomy of a Fall
4. Past Lives
5. Maestro
6. The Zone of Interest

&#x200B;

**Best Actor in a Motion Picture—Drama**

1. **Cillian Murphy—Oppenheimer**
2. Bradley Cooper—Maestro
3. Colman Domingo—Rustin
4. Leonardo DiCaprio—Killers of the Flower Moon
5. Barry Keoghan—Saltburn
6. Andrew Scott—All of Us Strangers

Cooper seems like a traditional Globes pick but those mediocre audience scores are impossible to ignore. With that said, even if Cooper wins here I will still predict Murphy for the other precursors. The lack of enthusiasm for Maestro is palpable whereas the opposite is true of Oppenheimer. I don’t even think Cooper’s performance is that baity, he has like two Oscar clips total and the rest of his performance is fairly underplayed.

&#x200B;

**Best Actress in a Motion Picture—Drama**

1. **Lily Gladstone—Killers of the Flower Moon**
2. Sandra Huller—Anatomy of a Fall
3. Annette Bening—Nyad
4. Carey Mulligan—Maestro
5. Cailee Spaeny—Priscilla
6. Greta Lee—Past Lives

For a while I was predicting Huller, but I’m not really convinced that she has the monopoly on international and highbrow support that she needs to win. KOTFM did excellent with BAFTA longlists and AACTA noms and Gladstone won NYFCC, indicating support from the two above groups in addition to more mainstream audiences. Huller is absolutely possible because the European contingent could just overwhelmingly be in her favour but for right now I’m gonna have to default to Gladstone.

&#x200B;

**Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy**

1. **Poor Things**
2. Barbie
3. The Holdovers
4. May December
5. American Fiction
6. Air

Another difficult category but ultimately leaning Poor Things, mainly because it’s been matching Barbie’s performance at most places and has recency bias on its side. Not to mention that Poor Things did actually max out on nominations  herewhereas Barbie did not, and the mainstream vote that would go for Barbie is being split between Holdovers and American Fiction (and theoretically Air) whereas Poor Things only has \*I guess\* May December to worry about. Wouldn’t at all be shocked if Barbie took it but I’m sticking with my gut here.

&#x200B;

**Best Actor in a Motion Picture—Comedy or Musical**

1. **Paul Giamatti—The Holdovers**
2. Jeffrey Wright—American Fiction
3. Matt Damon—Air
4. Timothee Chalamet—Wonka
5. Nicolas Cage—Dream Scenario
6. Joaquin Phoenix—Beau is Afraid

Both of the frontrunners’ movies underperformed with nominations and logically it wouldn’t make much sense for Holdovers to be loved enough to win 2 acting awards and yet still miss Director and Screenplay. With that said, the main reason I’m putting Giamatti above Wright is this: Focus>>>Amazon. The former’s a much better campaigner than the latter and that fact alone could propel Giamatti to a win.

&#x200B;

**Best Actress in a Motion Picture—Comedy or Musical**

1. **Emma Stone—Poor Things**
2. Margot Robbie—Barbie
3. Natalie Portman—May December
4. Fantasia Barrino—The Colour Purple
5. Alma Poysti—Fallen Leaves
6. Jennifer Lawrence—No Hard Feelings

&#x200B;

**Best Director**

1. **Christopher Nolan—Oppenheimer**
2. Martin Scorsese—Killers of the Flower Moon
3. Yorgos Lanthimos—Poor Things
4. Greta Gerwig—Barbie
5. Celine Song—Past Lives
6. Bradley Cooper—Maestro

&#x200B;

**Best Screenplay**

1. **Barbie**
2. Oppenheimer
3. Poor Things
4. Anatomy of a Fall
5. Past Lives
6. Killers of the Flower Moon

Easily the toughest category of the night, you can probably make arguments for all 6–KOTFM as a default choice, Past Lives as the consolation award for a film they loved, Anatomy as the Euro pick, Oppenheimer as the sweeper, and Poor Things to go along with the musical/comedy package. But unlike in BP, Barbie’s not splitting any votes with mainstream films, whereas international/highbrow voters will be split between Poor Things, Anatomy, and Past Lives. Oppenheimer and KOTFM are also overshadowed by their directors in the awards conversation and I can’t predict Oppenheimer to win THAT much stuff.  Additionally, I think that voters will be inclined to finally give Gerwig and Baumbach a win, especially since they’re big names even outside of the US.

&#x200B;

**Best Supporting Actor**

1. **Robert Downey Jr.—Oppenheimer**
2. Ryan Gosling—Barbie
3. Charles Melton—May December
4. Mark Ruffalo—Poor Things
5. Robert De Niro—Killers of the Flower Moon
6. Willem Dafoe—Poor Things

If Gosling was sweeping regionals then I’d more buy into the hype necessary for him to win. But losing them not just in general, but to Downey Jr., specifically, indicates to me that the latter’s winning. This is definitely not locked up though and I wouldn’t bat an eye if he won. I also can’t really predict Barbie to win Screenplay and Supporting Actor but not Picture.

&#x200B;

**Best Supporting Actress**

1. **Da’Vine Joy Randolph—The Holdovers**
2. Jodie Foster—NYAD
3. Rosamund Pike—Saltburn
4. Danielle Brooks—The Colour Purple
5. Julianne Moore—May December
6. Emily Blunt—Oppenheimer

At this point I’m not even sure who the hypothetical competition for Randolph would be so I’m just putting Jodie at number two because ~~maybe if I manifest it hard enough it can actually happen~~ her performance is the only one that feels like a traditional winner.

&#x200B;

**Best Animated Film**

1. **Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse**
2. The Boy and the Heron
3. Suzume
4. Elemental
5. The Super Mario Bros Movie
6. Wish

Way more competitive than most people realize considering that Boy and the Heron got Score and would have consensus highbrow support whereas Spider-Verse would not necessarily have consensus basic support. With that said will there actually be enough people voting for Elemental or Mario to make a big difference?

&#x200B;

**Best Foreign Language Film**

1. **Past Lives**
2. Anatomy of a Fall
3. The Zone of Interest
4. Fallen Leaves
5. Society of the Snow
6. Io Capitano

Past Lives did better with nominations than Anatomy so I have no reason to doubt it winning.

&#x200B;

**Best Original Score**

1. **Oppenheimer**
2. Killers of the Flower Moon
3. The Boy and the Heron
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
5. The Zone of Interest
6. Poor Things

Oppenheimer’s the easy frontrunner but the fact Boy and the Heron made it at all is impressive enough for me to say it could win. Clearly if they’re willing to namecheck Hisashi in the first place, who’s to say that they won’t namecheck him for the win as well? KOTFM is also here and has a shot but has a lot less passion for it, plus I don’t really think voters will care about that composer’s narrative. I only have it above Heron because it would be a far more conventional winner.

&#x200B;

**Best Original Song**

1. **“What Was I Made For?”—Barbie**
2. “I’m Just Ken”—Barbie
3. “Road to Freedom”—Rustin
4. “Peaches”—The Super Mario Bros. Movie
5. “Dance the Night”—Barbie
6. “Addicted to Romance”—She Came to Me

You could argue that, like Animated, vote splitting between all the heartfelt ballads will help Ken come on top, but I think it’s way more plausible that vote splitting with the fun songs Dance the Night and Peaches will work to What Was I Made For’s benefit. Plus, like I’ve said elsewhere, WWIMF was just as memorable in Barbie as I’m Just Ken, so the latter doesn’t necessarily have the cultural impact argument in its favour their either. There’s also the possibility that Barbie songs all split votes and something shocking wins but obviously I’m not gonna bet on that.

&#x200B;

**Box Office Achievement**

1. **Barbie**
2. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour
3. Oppenheimer
4. The Super Mario Bros. Movie
5. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
6. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume II
7. John Wick: Chapter 4
8. Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One

If Barbie wins Comedy/Musical then it’s probably losing this since voters might want to spread the wealth. Swift makes the most sense since Oppenheimer’s already getting awarded a ton and literally none of these other movies feel like something they’d vote for.",11,0.79,2024-01-07 4:27:44,23
Oppenheimer definitely the big winner,https://i.redd.it/0wz0er1ah5bc1.jpeg,,79,0.94,2024-01-08 5:15:05,27
Barbie in Singapore / JB (Malaysia)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barbie/comments/19085l3/barbie_in_singapore_jb_malaysia/,"I’ll be going to Singapore soon, yay! I used to get my (collectible) Barbie fix from all the major shops like Takashimaya, Metro etc but also Magma Heritage until like 10-15 years ago. Barbie was seemingly less popular the last few years but I’m sure the Barbie movie has revived interest in her a bit!

Where do my fellow collectors from Singapore or JB get their Barbies? And are Lazada and Shopee reliable? 

Thanks in advance!!",2,1,2024-01-06 19:40:11,0
What we can learn from Duolingo's fast user growth.,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockDeepDives/comments/19277j6/what_we_can_learn_from_duolingos_fast_user_growth/,"Duolingo wasn't always growing as fast its growing today.   Just 2 years ago, MAU growth was essentially **flat**.  

&#x200B;

[Duolingo MAU growth.](https://preview.redd.it/ce5nxhctocbc1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba4abb38e4a4fa2f506be6e394efe5786255e748)

How the company resumed growth is one of the greater examples of how **process power** can propel a company to new heights over time.  Indeed, no one could have predicted that Duolingo was going to grow like this since Q1 2022. But the point is this was likely to happen, given the company's process power.  So, how did Duolingo do this?  

&#x200B;

In an article by [@lennysan](https://twitter.com/lennysan), former CPO of Duolingo Jorge Mazal explains how they revived DAU/MAU growth by building an exhaustive model of the user flow.  

The model led the team to identify a **metric** that increased at a 2% rate every quarter for three years and would have an outsized impact on DAU growth:  **CURR** (current user retention).  

Duolingo got to work on building features that would drive CURR and, through trial and error, eventually found **three broad vectors** that worked:  

1. A league system that incentivized users to compete and therefore made the app stickier.  

2. A much higher level of flexibility in push notifications.  

3. The streak system, which shows users how many consecutive days they’ve done activity on the app.  

These three vectors have meaningfully increased CURR, which have largely led to the rapid growth that you see in the graph above.  

Yet, **none** of these vectors could have been predicted by anyone at Duolingo before the A/B testing showed promise. 

That’s why management always has A/B tests to thank when asked about fast product improvements.

  ""Currently user retention rate is probably the biggest lever that we've had.   It's not the only one but it's the biggest lever that we have to move. We expect there's still a lot of room there for us to improve.  For user growth, we believe that the main thing that has affected user growth is improvements in free user retention.   **That's it**.""  

\-Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn during the Q3 2023 earnings call.  

Duolingo also disclosed in Q2 2023 the Family Plan, which allegedly **increases LTV** (user life time value). This is because even if you stop using the app, so long as one of your kids is using it you still pay for the Family Plan.  It’s no coincidence that DAUs as a percentage of MAUs continue to grow robustly. 

&#x200B;

[Duolingo DAU as &#37; of MAU.](https://preview.redd.it/4ukrb7q3pcbc1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=af12d12bb7f835d83638a3699659ccbab363e625)

 

Evidence of Duolingo’s process power extends beyond intrinsic product features.  During Q3 2023 Duolingo was referenced in the latest **Barbie movie**, which aided growth during the quarter.

 In the Q&A section, CEO Luis von Ahn said the following about this:  

""And the combination of getting much better with marketing and the getting better has made it so that Duolingo has really struck a cord with this.  Part of the reason that we've exceeded our expectations is because things have happened that there was no way for us to expect. We could not expect that, the Barbie movie was going to add Duolingo in there.""  

Reading Duolingo’s quarterly transcripts forward, I can see management expressing more confidence in the company’s ability to market itself.

And then, **all of a sudden**, the app is featured in a blockbuster movie.  **It is hard to describe process power, but it is hard to miss when in motion**.  

A company with this level of process power is **rare**. It is no surprise to me, however, that they continue to mention Spotify in their quarterly earnings calls.  Since IPO, Duolingo management has mentioned Spotify 13 times, and with a rather reverent tone at that. 

Why? 

Because if Amazon is king, Spotify is the prince of process power and heir apparent to the throne.  

Spotify’s free-to-paid user conversion is **50%**. Duolingo’s conversion, despite its rapid progress, is **a sixth** of that.  At a price to sales ratio of 20.5, the market is relatively aware of Duolingo’s excellent organizational capabilities.

 Yet the key question is, Where or even what can Duolingo become **in a decade’s time**?",3,1,2024-01-09 5:32:40,0

🌕 🏆 2024 GOLDEN GLOBES MEGATHREAD 🏆🌕,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/19164jx/2024_golden_globes_megathread/,"Welcome to the live discussion thread for the 2024 Golden Globes!

&#x200B;

[From the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/movies/golden-globes-how-to-watch.html):

The bar for a successful Golden Globes is usually low: Did at least one winner crack an acceptance-speech joke they’d probably regret the next day? Was there unpredictable political pontificating? Was the champagne still flowing into the wee hours?

But then a [Los Angeles Times investigation](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021) in 2021 revealed that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the eccentric, cloistered nonprofit of about 85 journalists that voted on the Golden Globes for some seven decades, had exactly zero Black members. The event has spent the last two years undergoing a reboot: The [H.F.P.A. was dissolved](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/business/media/golden-globes-sale.html). Private ownership took over, and [new leadership was hired](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/golden-globes-awards-calendar-2024-tim-gray-1235709141/).

This year, the Globes are back on TV, in their normal Sunday-night slot. (NBC didn’t broadcast the event in 2022, and last year’s pared-back Globes were booted to a Tuesday night because of football.) Now they’re on CBS, and a diversified voting body of more than 300 entertainment journalists has chosen the winners and added two new categories. (Oh, and they also [found a new way to nominate Taylor Swift](https://people.com/taylor-swift-earns-golden-globes-nomination-eras-tour-film-8414209).)

Will it be enough to win back audiences? (The 2023 Globes had about [6.3 million viewers](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/business/media/golden-globe-viewership-declines.html), down 10 percent from the last televised Globes ceremony in 2021; by comparison, the Oscars draw about [19 million viewers](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/business/oscars-viewers-ratings.html).) Will the A-listers show up? Will the ceremony be a nod to the boozy, freewheeling affairs of old or play it more strait-laced like last year’s sober — some said, “[boring](https://nypost.com/2023/01/11/the-2023-golden-globes-should-have-never-come-back/)” — ceremony?

We’ll find out Sunday night. Here’s how to watch.

## What time does the show start, and where can I watch?

The ceremony begins at 8 p.m. EST, 5 p.m. PST at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif. CBS is the official television broadcaster.

Online, you can watch the show live on the CBS app, which is free to download, though you’ll need to sign in using the credentials from your cable provider. The show will also stream on Paramount+, though only subscribers who have the premium Paramount+ with Showtime plan will be able to watch live. For those who do not, the ceremony can be streamed beginning Monday on Paramount+. There are also a number of live TV streaming services that offer access to CBS, including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV and FuboTV, which all require subscriptions, though many are offering free trials.

## Is there a red carpet?

[Variety](https://variety.com/) will stream red carpet arrivals beginning at 6:30 p.m. EST, 3:30 p.m. PST on its website and social media platforms as part of the official Globes preshow. You can also watch on [ETonline.com](https://www.etonline.com/) or the [Golden Globes website](https://goldenglobes.com/).

## Who is hosting?

The comedian and actor [Jo Koy](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/movies/jo-koy-easter-sunday.html), who has released multiple Netflix specials and starred in the comedy movie “[Easter Sunday](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/movies/easter-sunday-review.html)” in 2022, will take the reins for the first time.

## Who votes on the awards?

With the H.F.P.A. dissolved, an expanded group of more than 300 entertainment journalists from around the world is now responsible for selecting the nominees and winners. And the Globes have promised it’s a much more diverse group that now includes Black voters.

## What’s new this year?

The Globes introduced two new categories, one for stand-up comedy on television and the other for blockbuster films — defined as those taking in at least $100 million at the domestic box office and $150 million worldwide (hello, “Barbie”-”Oppenheimer”-“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” showdown).

With the exception of the blockbuster category, which has eight slots, the categories now have six nominees each, up from five. In other words, more stars to populate the televised ceremony and the red carpet spectacle.

## Who is nominated?

“Barbie,” Greta Gerwig’s live-action take on the popular doll, leads the pack with eight nominations, including three in the original song category. (Yes, “[I’m Just Ken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwux9KiBMjE)” made the cut.) Close on its heels is “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s three-hour blockbuster biopic about the theoretical physicist who led the effort that produced the first nuclear weapons. It’s up for best drama, director and actor, among other awards.

On the TV side, it looks to be a big night for “Succession,” which ended last spring and earned a record nine nominations. The audience favorites “The Bear” and “Only Murders in the Building” picked up five apiece.

## What should you watch for?

“Oppenheimer” will be looking to bolster its case at the Oscars with wins here in the best drama and director categories. But don’t count out “Killers of the Flower Moon,” whose female lead, Lily Gladstone, could become the first Indigenous performer to win best actress in a drama.

Among the TV nominees, Meryl Streep, who is up for best supporting actress in a comedy for her role as the actress Loretta Durkin in Season 3 of “Only Murders in the Building,” could break her own record for the most Golden Globe acting wins with a victory (this would be her ninth statuette). Ali Wong, who played a successful businesswoman drawn into a road-rage-fueled feud in the Netflix comedy “Beef,” could become the first actress of Asian descent to win best actress in the limited series category.

And, if “Succession” wins best drama, it will tie the record for most wins in the category (currently held by “Mad Men” and “The X-Files,” which each have three).

## Will the winners in the TV categories offer any hints about the Emmys next week?

What a strange year: The dual actors’ and writers’ strikes that largely brought Hollywood to a standstill also bumped the Emmys from their normal September spot, even though voting took place in June. They’re now set to air after Jan. 15, even though the winners for the 2022-23 season were locked in months ago. Which is to say: Nope!

"a used plastic bag, feet and revenge on 6 year olds",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/193m0xx/a_used_plastic_bag_feet_and_revenge_on_6_year_olds/,"it's a bit of a click baity title. but some 6 year olds are indeed involved.

i'm not really a petty guy. i have some stories i could tell where i come of as petty, but i never mean it that way. i'm just an autistic dude with adhd. but i just remembered a story from my childhood where i was very intentionally petty. this is a bit relevant since some could get confused: i'm a trans man.


it was the summer of 2007 and for the first time in my long long life, my birthday wasn't on summer vacation. i was turning 7 🥳 it was also the first b-day ever my mom bought a present for me. so i was extra stoked. i got a barbie rapunzel doll for my birthday. this was THE shit the girls wanted. the movie had just been released the year prior (i'm not american) and the doll half a year later, so no one except for ME had that doll. don't worry, all this is really relevant.

i'm a kid who got bullied a lot. since kindergarten. and since every kid i went to kindergarten with was practically my neighbor, the bullying carried over to elementary school. i was not only a loser without friends. i was the loser between the losers. i was always alone. so obviously, i was even happier that all the popular girls wanted to talk to me and play with me on my b-day. but some of you already guessed it. the girls were obviously much more interested in my doll. because of my circumstances, i had to mature much faster than my peers, so obviously, i catched up almost immediately what was going on. i felt miserable almost the entire day until one of the girls asked something like, ""hey, you haven't already decided who sits with you, right? can we sit at your table?""

let me explain: back in my days👴 in my elementary school, whenever a child had their b-day on a school day, we would have a party at the end of that day. the b-day kid would choose up to 5 kids that were allowed to sit at the big round table with the b-day child.
usually, the parents would bring a cake or pie and some other sweets. some parents would even join. my mom obviously couldn't join, i knew she had 3 different jobs. she obviously didn't have any time.

every time the b-day child was pressured by their classmates into choosing 5 people. because after the b-day child, the kids at their table would be the next ones getting served a slice of cake or sweets, etc. and obviously, they were also allowed to choose the games as well. kids being kids, that was seen as ""super cool."" basically, if you were tight with the b-day kid, you were at the top of the food chain. almost always the popular kids where the ones sitting at that table, making them even more popular.

listen, my little brother required much more attention, so i was basically accustomed to not getting what i wanted. i didn't care about the seating. but i also knew THEY cared a lot about it. so after getting treated like shit the whole day, i was thinking ""you know what, fuck it. (obviously paraphrasing here :D) tomorrow begins summer vacation and even after that, we're moving out, i'm not going to see these fuckers ever again.""
so i had this glorious idea. i had a plasic bag in my backpack. (most of the time i used a plastic bag to pack my lunches, because mother taught us to ✨️recycle✨️ 💅)

so, the girl is asking me that question and i'm like ""hold on"", go to my backpack, pull out the empty used plasic bag, look them straight in the eyes and say ""the first 5 willing to put their bare foot into this used plastic bag for a minute are the ones i will choose to sit with me."" first, they were reluctant but one by one they did it.
i was feeling SO fucking good.
i was obviously not going to choose them.
but when the time was nigh🏴‍☠️(near), i felt a bit bad for them after all.

now wait a sec, let's go back to my mom. like i said, she didn't have time because she was busy providing for us. so obviously i wasn't expecting anything big. anything at all, honestly. my teacher did tell me around noon that my mom had dropped around lunch time to bring my cake. i was happy about that, but like i said, i didn't expect anything more than a store-bought cake.

so, i was starting to feel bad. contemplating whether i should do it or not until my teacher asked me to set up the table with her. i was extremely surprised. my mom hadn't bought a cake. she MADE that shit. my mother, who had 3 jobs, 5 kids and on top of that diabetes had made a huge fucking cake for me. but no no no, of course we're talking about my mom here, she had also made OTHER baked goods on top of that AND cooked a meal for the whole ass class.
thanks to my mom, not only was i convinced to take my tiny little revenge, i was also going out with a fucking BANG.

choosing time.... and obviously the popular girls were expecting their names being called out. but damn i must've been REALLY pissed, because i remember i knew exactly which people i was going to choose, but every time i called out a name, i made a huge dramatic pause between each name, seeing the girls faces turn from hopeful to disappointed each fucking time. and i'm convinced the universe was on my side bc the popular kids were all seated to the back. having a miserable time.
and that's how i used a plastic bag to get my tiny, petty, dirty revenge.


remembering this story, i miss my mom even more now. (no, not dead. just transphobic.) she gave it her all to raise us, and even after everything i went through, you could say i would still glady give up a foot for her.


edit: sry for grammar or spelling mistakes. english is my 3rd language.

2. edit: since some people didn't get what was up with the plastic bag. it was completely random that i chose it, but like i already mentioned, i was always packing my lunches in reusable plastic bags. so, yeah, i knew the bag was dirty, and it would be gross to put a whole foot in there for a minute. for why i used it, i wanted them to ""prove"" me that they were really willing to sit at the table, so i could humiliate them even more after. i didn't mention, though, that everyone was watching them while they were doing that. and kids being kids, they obviously got laughed at. hence the humiliation part. another thing i want to mention is that i don't mind compliments, but this story is almost 2 decades old, and i was just retelling a story i remembered. i've been over it for quite some time. i was just remembering it because my bf and i were talking about my birthday for this year. now, if you could excuse me, i have to finish my ritual for cursing my enemies. have a great day, gang 🤝✨️",163,0.9,2024-01-10 23:02:09,23
AITA for obviously favoring of my niece?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191jpk7/aita_for_obviously_favoring_of_my_niece/,"Using fake names for obvious reasons.

I (35F) have been married to my wife (Amy - 33F) for the past 10 years. I have no siblings. Amy has a brother (Max - 40M) who has three kids, two sons (Leo 6 and Ryan 5) and a daughter (Anne 8). We have two kids (Sarah 7 and Ava 5). 

Now I love all of Max's children. And they get along really well with our kids. They constantly have sleepovers and play together, etc. Leo and Ryan are walking earthquakes. They're pretty active kids who enjoy physical activities much more than anything else. Anne is more laid back, and we have a special bond.

For example, my wife and I have a thing where we play chess or do crafts with our girls. Anne usually joins and asks us to sit with her. She also likes my profession (I'm an ENT doctor) and asks me all kinds of questions. (She loves the idea of being able to see inside one's nose and ear).

For Christmas, we got all of Max's kids a special gift. They came over for dinner one day during the holidays. Now I'd already gotten Anne her very own chess set around a month ago, and hadn't been able to give it to her because I kept forgetting it and it was in my office for a good while.

However, I thought I'd just give her the gift while she was with us. Amy also agreed and said it would be a good idea and she could play chess with her friends etc. Max seemed to hate the idea. When the kids were gone he told me I was being sexist for clearly favoring his daughter, and said I needed to treat his kids equally.

I said I just wanted to give a special gift, Amy took my side and said Max was being very petty about something as innocent as this. He is still upset with me. I wanted to apologise but Amy said I don't need to because I didn't do anything wrong. Was it an AH move to give her the chess set then?

Edit: I got Leo all kinds of baseball stuff like bat, jersey, ball, etc. I got Ryan a bike. I knew they specifically like those activities. The original gift for Anne was a barbie dollhouse since she loved the movie, and I gave her this chess set later as something I bought a month ago",953,0.93,2024-01-08 12:02:41,192

Fashion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zillennials/comments/190z4ju/fashion/,"The 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s each brought iconic and bizarre fashion trends. Which decade's fashion do you find most intriguing, perplexing, or downright unforgettable, and give an opinion.

1. 2020s

this decade is bursting with experimentation and freedom. Unlike earlier decades, there  is less judging and more ""go for it!"" energy. I wouldn't have seen myself rocking head-to-toe pink for a Barbie movie date with my girlfriend. 

2. 2010s

The 2010s were my teenage kingdom, a land of swag, hipster glasses, and Hollister hoodies. Rue21 was my fashion cathedral, but I can't quite recall all the trends I worshipped there. Can you help me jog my memory?

2000s

Early 2000s fashion (2000-2003) was awesome, but then 2004-2009 happened... what went wrong? Emo took over and everything got kinda dark. What changed the vibe so much? Everyone dressed like Twilight.

What do actors mean when they ‘Find the character within me’?,https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/190pr3u/what_do_actors_mean_when_they_find_the_character/,"From binging a lot of interviews I realized actors and actresses say this a lot when they talk about the character the created in a movie or play.

I recall Margot Robbie mentioned she did animal work, accent coach to help her find Barbie within her. Some others mentioned shadowing the real life person. But I don’t get the concept.

So hypothetically, if I have a flatmate, and I was to act like him on stage, how do I find him within me? (Besides voice and gesture imitation)

Can someone explain to me what actors do to find the character within themselves?

If you have some resources that help me understand the process I’d absolutely appreciate that too!",9,0.92,2024-01-07 10:59:07,4

"Late to the game, but Barbie wasn't that great of a movie. (Spoilers)",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/18tnbur/late_to_the_game_but_barbie_wasnt_that_great_of_a/,"Before you jump to the comments calling me a misogynist who didn't get the message or the satire, I did. Everyone did. It isn't that deep. I'm also not bitter at the message because I'm a man, either, it just wasn't that great of a movie.

My gripe was more with the actual movie itself than the message, because if you just take the premise of the movie--Barbie becomes sentient and wants to become a person but she realizes that the world isn't as 'perfect' as Barbie World, and plays on the riff of the helpless female side character by shoehorning Ken into the role. You couldn't miss that because the subtly is like a brick to the face, and this is where my issues with the film start.

First and foremost, it wasn't a horrible movie, it wasn't a great movie, it was just a movie. It got me to scoff laugh a couple of times, but ultimately I'd give it a 2.5/5, maybe a 3/5.

My issues with the film are as follows:

1. The 'message' is far too ham fisted, it takes away the humor by making each and every joke or scene far too obvious as a 'men vs women' bit. They really could have toned down the forced message in the film to the same effect, while actually contributing more to sending a message by making the humor more impactful and effective. We get it, Barbie is perfect perfect perfect and the world is so not perfect because *gasp* boys are big bad CEOs and construction workers?! The film honestly felt like a 2 hour SNL skit that didn't make the final cut. It was trying so hard to make a film predicated on a satirical, intelligent parody of a taboo topic that it forgot to make the humor actually intelligent. Add on top of that America Ferrara's rant 2/3 of the way into the film where she has to basically tell the audience what to think about feminism all but assures the viewer that the director and screen writers think the audience is too stupid to handle subtly.
2. Outside of Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie, the acting is really not that great. It's carried so hard by these two it's unreal, Robbie having her 'I'm not beautiful moment' where she has her meltdown in the Weird Barbie house stood out so far above the rest of the film because she does such a fantastic job with her acting. Everyone else is basically just loud, obnoxious, or blunt and that's their 'acting'.
3. It can't seem to pick a lane on what it wants the tone to be, zany and wacky with balls to the wall humor or a serious, dramatic statement piece about the role of women in society and how their value is judged. The film would have been far better toning down the forced, constant humor, and actually letting the tonality of the film lean more into the serious nature while still providing well-timed and genuinely funny comedy to bring levity. But you have moments like when Barbie realizes the world around her is imperfect, and there are far more things going on around her, and she cries for the first time and has a moment where she feels real--then turns to an older woman and tells her how beautiful she is, only for it to get abruptly cut off by Ken running back and the plot line returning to zany, wacky Barbie dolls in the real world. This is paired by moments where the real world brings Barbie and Ken to reality, then we have a Benny Hill style chase in the Mattel headquarters like some Saturday cartoon.

At the end of the day, the movie was just Life-Sized but with more of an emphasis on expectations of women and more existential dread. It wasn't great, it wasn't awful, people need to just settle down and realize that the film was mediocre.

  
EDIT: Completely forgot to mention that the whole 'bitchy anti-capitalist daughter and sweet caring mom who don't see eye to eye' subplot was fucking atrocious. For no reason whatsoever the daughter suddenly switches on a dime when she decides that they need to save Barbie despite her disapproval of capitalism driven content, and the daughter and mom suddenly forget they don't get along and the daughter magically isn't bitchy anymore because they reconciled for the sake of the plot?",59,0.8,2023-12-29 13:38:52,50

Why everyone judge a movie on its morality rather than thinking about its story?,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/18zays0/why_everyone_judge_a_movie_on_its_morality_rather/,"It might get started in this generation only where people are becoming so much soft and insecure about their morality and ideology that if someone said something different and spoke against their morality they and easily triggered. Now the fact everyone has their own freedom of speech and they tend to have a different opinion and they have also the right to defend their opinion. I understand this but getting triggered upon movie's or director's morality or ideology is like something else. Recently in 2023 I would talk about two movies Barbie and our own Animal.  These two movie in terms of ideology and thinking are too much different, you can say they are quite opposite of each other. But the fact is these two movies get criticized for their ideology. And the fact they weren't get criticized by only audience they also got criticized by So called Movie Reviewer. Who says that they judge movie on the basis of it filmography. Several Reviewers criticized barbie only bcz of its morality and some reviewers or critics praise Animal and defend it's ideology and vice versa. My only question is why just don't enjoy the movie. If you wanted to critcize anything it would be it's story, acting, cinematography, direction etc. That makes a lot of sense. But in terms of looking superior you might wanna critized it's ideology. A youtuber idk his name, he claims himself a reviewers and what he do just judge every movie on the basis of it's political ideology even if there is nothing political beliefs in the movie. If you agree with the point that everybody has a right to present their opinion or defending it then why you got triggered by a movie. It's someone else thinking. It's his ideology. Greta And Sandeep got so much unnecessary hate for their movie like even it's a worth a damn. And the fact both movie did a great collection and become super hit. For me both movies were quite average in terms of story. Where Barbie gets a slight edge bcz of it world building. But Animal has great screenplay in my opinion. They weren't the best movie I have ever seen but they aren't like what ig and yt content makers sells you.",3,0.67,2024-01-05 16:31:31,22

[M4A] Looking for someone to Rp as Margot Robbie for me in a BBC Blowjob scenario,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebDPP/comments/191hqsq/m4a_looking_for_someone_to_rp_as_margot_robbie/,"I am 18+ and looking for 18+ only. 

Looking for a detailed roleplay partner

Hi everyone i'm looking for someone to play as the beautiful Margot Robbie for me in a Blowjob scenario. If you like Margot and can play her well full of her personality is a bonus. Margot is perfect for BBC and she must be such a size queen

Scene 1 - Margot the hot business woman - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/938506947399929916/1183798414618673202/mr16.jpg?ex=6589a52f&is=6577302f&hm=49a7eb4964efc130beb3bc859e222829190c02376f8f0e3bb0b60e6eee947875&

What i'm thinking its Margot is in her Lucky Chap office one day and is on her laptop sending emails, and video calls just generally her being business woman like bossy a bit bitchy. She is in the office doing some business work for her company and some Barbie promo campaign documents

I can either be a new intern working in your office & you have heard rumors i am very well hung and would like to see for yourself and you admit to being into black cocks in blunt way. Or i can be a black guy you see on a regular basis to get your BBC fix or.

In this scenario you as Margot would be in full control like you could say to me to get naked as you close the blinds and lock the door. Or i could get buzzed thru to your office from one door. Then before i enter your room i take my 9 inch BBC out and walk in on you catching you off guard as you finish off a phone call or typing away on your laptop sending an email, as you signal me over with your other hand/finger.

Many ways we could play this out and i'm open to your suggestions ideas for the scene so we can play it out. As Business woman Margot is really hot to think about and her getting a nice Big Black Cock is really hot to imagine her doing her office on a break or just during day in the office.

Scene 2

Margot goes into a quiet sauna thinking she is all alone being her usual happy fun self. It's a private sauna located in LA and they have kept it open just for her as they think everyone has left. Margot would be so much fun in this setup as i can imagine she would be extremely verbal and vocal during it and very flirty and teasing before the blowjob action as well as during it I can imagine Margot walking into the sauna and not realizing there’s another guy in there. Closing her eyes and unwrapping her towel to expose her nude body. After a while, she sees my large BBC sticking out opposite her. Margot apologizing, thinking that she was the only one in there. Telling him that she prefers to be in the sauna without any clothes as she introduces herself. Both of them casually chatting to each other while naked, slowly getting turned on by each other’s bodies. They can be chatting naked opposite each other in the sauna. My cock getting harder at the sight of Margot's naked body and her perky tits though from Margot’s face it’s clear she doesn’t mind at all seeing the naked hung stud and his massive black cock opposite her. maybe it could be taking place where the production for one of her movies is taking place in LA like Barbie. The sauna could be located on one of the streets near to where they are filming and she is not needed on set for a few hours when our meet and blowjob takes place. As its an exclusive sauna for the rich and famous of LA where celebs get high priority over other people

Scene 3

Seeing as she is still new with black cock its a random hook-up in LA you have messaged me about wanting to link up and get some black cock in your mouth & we decide to meet up in the Hollywood Hills in a quiet spot overlooking the city. It starts off us just chatting generally in the car chatting about your movies how busy you have been & how you don't get much time to be yourself, you flirt with me with some build-up then you suck me off in the car for a while but we then take it outside and you carry on sucking me off out beside the car. What i am thinking is maybe Margot has left a gala or afterparty for this hook up & it could be her 3rd or 4th ever BBC. We would of got in contact thru some exclusive Hollywood dating app for celebs and the wealthy or i can just be either a young co-star who starred in one of your movies a small-time role in the movie or a complete stranger off the app. That is up too you open to other suggestions and ideas for this iset up.

Scene 4 - Cruise ship Ambassador promoting Barbie and her gin range Papa Salt

Margot is on a cruise ship as an ambassador for the liner but she is also on there to promote Barbie and also promote her new gin range Papa Salt Gin range to sell it to potential customers who are on board the cruise ship. I can play as either a fan who happens to meet you on the cruise or part of the crew assigned to help you on this part of the cruise. Where i help set up areas for you to promote it and talk about it etc and we get close over the coming days you flirt with me we go for drinks when we are not working and it ends up you sucking on my massive black cock one afternoon on the private deck of your boat. Or it could be its been a busy few days on the boat doing various promotions all around the boat at different times. On this day we have a day off from promotional duties and you have a key to my room on the ship and you come into my room to have a good old chat and catch up about the few days you have left on the ship etc. Anyway, i'm in the shower unaware you have come into my quarters for a catch-up too see how i'm doing. When i walk out from the shower naked and fully erect, you are sitting on one of the sofas in the main part of my cabin on your phone when i walk out as i was getting some water, when you see just how big my black cock is, it impresses you and you had a feeling i was big but not that big, you get a few seflies with it and it leads too the Blowjob.

I will play as a well built black guy with a slim toned muscular body i'm 5ft 11 with a 9 inch BBC

If you are interested in playing as Margot for me send me a pic of what you will look like in the scene you have chosen. I'm also open to any of your suggestions or ideas for the set ups to discuss so that we can rp. I hope to hear from you

Any future for Ben Solo even if it’s not in the next movie? Star Wars,https://www.reddit.com/r/reylo/comments/190a5mo/any_future_for_ben_solo_even_if_its_not_in_the/,"Do you think there will be any chance that Star Wars could bring back Ben Solo after this next upcoming movie? There’s obviously so much controversy over this next movie and Ben Solo not coming back. Like will they forget his existence and not even talk about him? 

They were a dyad in the force…

 It seems that Star Wars and Disney are making decisions that are annoying/losing fans. 

It’s important to have strong female characters. But just make a good Star Wars movie with strong female characters. Leia, Padme, and Rey have empowered girls and women. I would’ve liked to have seen Rose with a bigger part too. I think there are a lot of strong women in the Star Wars universe. The new Star Wars being a feminist movie makes me not want to see it. And I’m a feminist. I went to see Barbie knowing it would be a feminist movie and enjoyed it. But for a Star Wars movie, only focusing on the women doesn’t make sense.   


I thought that Rey was the main character in the last three movies too… so saying it’s time for a female lead doesn’t make sense if she was the lead before. Great that she’s a lead again but I’m worried they’ll ruin the character. Thought they’d want to incorporate the World between Worlds somehow (but this coming from someone who was a fan of Reylo or just Pride and Prejudice/Beauty and the Beast). Like how sad was it when they found each other at the end and then he disappeared? Could Ben Solo come back/redeem himself or even come back as a force ghost? 


They must know that fans are upset ben solo isn’t coming back. If it’s a flop at the Box Office, that should tell them to listen to the fans more…but they probably won’t listen. Star Wars was once explained as a space fantasy. Maybe I was a fan of Reylo. The possibility of Ben Solo coming back to the light. Being a strong female character and also having a relationship doesn’t make her weak.  The potential that will never come…

I’m a Star Wars fan I’m not so sure anymore. 

I’m sure some people will disagree. Just curious about what people think.",39,0.94,2024-01-06 21:05:28,76
What is your favorite doll line and why?,https://i.redd.it/fkjiesuygoac1.jpeg,"(it doesn't have to be specific, it can be something like, bjd or porcelain)My favorite is now barbie (used to be monster high) after I got back into collecting, I didn't care about barbie at all, I thought the dolls were all ugly and lazily designed but that's because I only saw the play line dolls and none of them interested me, after seeing the movie, new collector dolls, and the vintage dolls, I fell in love. (I do appreciate a few of them now after seeing more) There are thousands of babies so you are guaranteed to like at least 1. Some more reasons is, they were the first fashion doll line targeted towards children and they are the most successful doll line! Some things I wish were different about barbie is, their shoes have little to no detail, they have no articulation.(Minus made to move dolls) I have all mine displayed in a dream house and it's my favorite display area in my room! I want to get evening sophisticate because it's a stunning doll, I also just got a vintage closet from the 60's.",18,1,2024-01-05 20:03:04,9

I’ve had pretty good results since starting Tirz in early October. I haven’t had any side effects really, except for skin soreness on my very first dose, and occasional fatigue when upping my dose.
I’ve been on 5.5mg every 5-6 days for the past month. Food noise and appetite suppression comes and goes but it’s manageable, and I’m still losing so it’s all good.
However, I’ve realize I have become an emotional mess, like at the drop of a dime. Everything makes me want to cry. I don’t, typically now, because I’m like what is happening? (I cried at the Barbie movie, Jack Frost made me tear up🤦‍♀️, I just got emotional about the guy in nefarious????) lol but I find myself having a lump in my throat or my eyes welling up at almost anything. This is pretty regular when I’m around my cycle but now it’s just an every day thing for the past month or two. I take wellbutrin for depression and anxiety daily, and have for the past 5 years. 
I don’t know what’s going on, but it doesn’t seem normal. It’s just increasingly more abnormal for me. Has anyone else experienced this? Does it subside? Please tell me it doesn’t get worse with higher doses 😭😂",2,1,2024-01-08 4:04:01,2

AITA for upsetting my friend afte he made a bad ‘joke’,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/192na6y/aita_for_upsetting_my_friend_afte_he_made_a_bad/,"TW: mentions of rape and eating disorders            I (f14) is in a friend group with several girls and two guys let’s call them L (m13) and F (m14) they are two very good friends of mine but have started making some very offensive jokes recently.

 The first situation was when my friend group was out in a shopping mall before seeing a movie, while in a shop L and F started very loudly joking about rape to each other. A group of girls around our age nearby looked very upset, my other friends (all female) and I decided to leave the shop without the boys because we were upset by there so called ‘jokes’ ,another joke L made was ‘I forgot to eat today I’m so anorexic’
This was probably the least concerning of his comments.
 
More instances is F commenting on me and one of my friends appearances referring to us as ‘meaty’ and ‘skin and bone’ this wouldn’t be so bad if he didn’t have a fit if we said they same to him. He has also referred to a women’s rights book as comedy. 

They have made a few more jokes about Epstein Island and things like that but yesterday things got a lot worse when L thought it would be funny to send in some lyrics, to a group chat we were all in that he thought was funny. Some of these lyrics included things such as ‘I’m gonna rape this little girl and put my babies in her’ along with other terrible things like this.

All the girls in the group chat including myself were really angry and started giving out to him for thinking this was okay to send and was funny.
F started defending him saying that they were juts Tyler The Creator lyrics and L didn’t write them, we all didn’t care and said stuff like why would you even share that though. L also refused to take accountability and thought his actions were okay.

Long story short L got upset we didn’t find this funny and stopped texting.
After about half an hour I tried to forget this and give L the benefit of the doubt but when I sent in a video of the Barbie golden globes joke L said ‘Whys he trying to fucking defend himself after it no’ and one of my friends said ‘L you’ve said worse‘
We all called him out again and when I said ‘why would you send that in the first place’ L said he thought the lyrics were funny.
The rest of us got really mad and L eventually apologised but not before saying stuff like
‘I give up on this shit’ 
‘Can we pls let this go now I can’t’ 
‘I'm after spending 2 hrs thinking yous all hated me And contemplating leaving the gc’

After this he gave a weak apology but I don’t believe he was sincere, the girls in the group including me discussed actions we can take like talking to the boys and telling them to change their behaviour or we won’t be friends with them anymore but we realised they wouldn’t react well and this would cause to much backlash like going to our school authorities as we have a group chat where we have out about their actions which would probably get us suspended and it would cause our friend in L class to much drama.

I have been very angry at both of them but more so L, today he has been acting like nothing has happened I decided to just not start conversations or talk to him as I don’t want to be friends with someone one who finds that stuff funny but this has upset him to be honest I don’t really care if I have hurt his feelings because he didn’t show any care towards ours when he made jokes about those things we have told him he doesn’t find them upsetting because he it doesn’t see it from our perspective.
 
I apologise for any spelling errors.
Their actions hurt us as they have made many sexist jokes and they don’t seem to care for our feelings, please comment any advice or suggestions you have.",3,1,2024-01-09 19:32:58,2
